Google Play,"Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",2,2023-07-08 14:18:24
Google Play,Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone,3,2023-07-19 20:52:48
Google Play,"For a brand new app, it's very well optimized. However it's just missing quite a few features that apps like Twitter have. There is no way to have your timeline show threads from who you're following. It would also be nice to be able to switch accounts quickly like on Insta. I've also noticed that videos have a hard time playing audio sometimes. Overall, it's a decent first version that I hope will get more features as time goes on. I'll up my rating once the things I mentioned are addressed.",3,2023-07-06 23:03:11
Google Play,"Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.",3,2023-07-10 00:53:25
Google Play,"The app is good, but it needs a lot of functionality. For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you. Hashtags could called Threads and make it easier to find topics and such. Needs lots of work. It can be a good app, but it feels rushed.",3,2023-07-06 16:57:43
Google Play,"Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.",2,2023-07-18 22:30:10
Google Play,"I still don’t want to see content from people that I don’t specifically follow unless I explicitly search for it. And when I do search, I want to see an option for complete searches and not just user searches. This is a bare-bones poor clone of Twitter that seemingly is just getting some initial traction due to political bias. No thanks - fix it. Also, if you don’t provide a web desktop option to use the service, it’s a double whammy.",1,2023-07-19 19:35:31
Google Play,"Could be great if all pages loaded when you clicked on them. Sometimes they just don't. Posts usually don't load at all. And my biggest thing: if you follow someone on Threads, you automatically follow them on Instagram as well. Either they're two separate apps or they're not. I would really like to be able to have a different list of people I follow on each app.",2,2023-07-06 14:35:15
Google Play,"I'm liking the concept! There is room for improvement though. Everytime I try to attach a photo to a thread, the app crashes. I haven't been able to add a photo at all. I also can't seem to find a way to view a list of only the people I follow. There's always other folks mixed in the list. Finally, I can't seem to edit my posts. I make a lot of typos! I can edit my posts on Facebook and Insta but not here? Weird.",3,2023-07-09 03:27:39
Google Play,"Not bad! This is its first launch. There is still room for improvements... I would like to see a trending page, longer videos, and an edit button for any threads(posts) uploaded by the user. Improve the loading time. Add a pause button(and slow motion controls for videos). A quality selection on videos(1080p, 720p, 480p, etc).",5,2023-07-06 23:41:13
Google Play,"Over all, the UI of this app is good. Using it is easy and visually it is very clean. Unfortunately, it fails in the functionality department. My home feed is 99% random people and not the accounts I actually follow which defeats the purpose of following someone in the first place. I recommend having the home feed be just the posts from people I follow and a separate discover/search page that will show new accounts who post similar content to those I follow.",2,2023-07-09 01:06:39
Google Play,"Nice but crashed & can't access photo folders. It crashed twice today so far in the middle of browsing. Also, for some reason, when I click the file button to attach a photo, it doesn't let me browse individual folders in my gallery...it shows my whole gallery which is inconvenient. Everything else is pretty okay and I expect it to get even better. Although another issue Meta should fix is that it shouldn't delete your Instagram if you decide to delete Threads lol please undo that.",3,2023-07-07 12:55:32
Google Play,"Pointless in following anyone. The feed algo won't show you the content you actually follow and want to see. I find myself opening this app wanting to like it but quickly get annoyed by seeing randomness. It's like you're invited to a party all your friends are at. Then you get there and it's nothing but strangers all trying to have incoherent, disjointed conversations with you at the same time. It's more stressful and annoying than engaging.",1,2023-07-14 16:15:10
Google Play,"Not quite ready for prime time. Needs a feed specifically for accounts you follow. If you have more than one Instagram account, Threads doesn't allow easy switching between accounts without involving logging out/logging in/security confirmation. This shouldn't need to be repeated over and over. Also, it is concerning that the app is blocked in the EU due to privacy violations. Use at your own risk.",2,2023-07-06 11:53:02
Google Play,"Very frustrating experience. Feed it's full of users I don't follow and don't care for their content. Switching between my company and private accounts forces you to complete sign out and reverify. Picture upload quality is compressed, Twitter images are much sharper. I am hopeful for this app, but it should have never been released as a finished product in it's current state.",2,2023-07-08 01:23:40
Google Play,"I like the simplicity of this app but there's definitely some bugs that need to get worked out. After choosing to sync with IG accounts I follow I weeded through them but about 1/3 that I unfollowed reappeared. I've done this 3x, closing out app to refresh, it keeps happening. Also, home page is super slow to refresh and posting a thread or reply is very slow to publish & sometimes freezes. Also wish that when trying to post a pic/video that one's device folders would appear & not just Gallery.",3,2023-07-06 15:35:46
Google Play,"It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.",2,2023-07-14 00:12:32
Google Play,"My first thoughts: Since there is no web version yet, it is very difficult when using it upright on a tablet. But I'm going to try it on a few phones today and I'm sure it will work fine. If the web version comes, it will really be more useful than I expected. The leaks of this app first appeared in April, which means it could only release stable later this year, but when they wanted to turn the troubles on Twitter into an opportunity, they released the app with many missing features.",3,2023-07-06 08:09:04
Google Play,"It's cool, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Post"" button at the top of the posting menu. Also, there's a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but needs some polish. Also, kinda wish there was an option to make an account from scratch rather than import an Instagram account.",3,2023-07-06 08:54:41
Google Play,"It's great, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Publish"" button at the top of the post menu. Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.",3,2023-07-14 12:46:21
Google Play,"I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. I have also found the app gets stuck updating and randomly crashes. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline.",2,2023-07-07 20:27:41
Google Play,"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface.",5,2023-07-06 18:39:12
Google Play,"It's not bad so far. A handful of unsolicited requests, but they're easy to despatch of. Clean feel and just seems nice and neat around the edges. It's like a flowing conversation. As a moderate social media user, it does everything I need it to for the type of app it is. Some sound and freezing issues with some videos I have viewed, though I am sure they'll iron these things out over the next couple of months",4,2023-07-07 20:00:49
Google Play,It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,3,2023-07-07 17:25:47
Google Play,"Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!",1,2023-07-09 19:04:24
Google Play,"The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 3 stars is just because of these bugs.",3,2023-07-06 13:34:56
Google Play,"I'm still wary of this app. But it's very promising. I love the interface design though there's still room for improvement. I personally experience lags while scrolling and I find that hard to navigate when the app keeps doing that. I also think it's better to implement the new emojis on the app but as well for instagram, too. Creating an account is a hassle if you just want to make a fandom one. And I find it a hassle to go to another app just to change my display name. I hope that'll change.",3,2023-07-06 05:59:52
Google Play,"Very easy to use because it's just like Twitter. But I'm starting to hate it because Instagram's best traits are being removed. Reactions for chats, and music for stories? Might as well just remove this app threads. Instagram is being loved through posting pictures but it is very convenient for having conversations with reactions if you don't know what to say. Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.",2,2023-07-07 12:52:07
Google Play,"As soon as I opened the app, it went good, the login and all, but as soon as it loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting so weird, like a bug or smth. All pages are overlapping on each other, I can't even interact with anything because as soon I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. Even reinstalling didn't help fix this issue",1,2023-07-06 16:13:41
Google Play,"Great App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.",4,2023-07-11 12:50:24
Google Play,"It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.",2,2023-07-15 18:37:18
Google Play,"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.",2,2023-07-07 12:56:59
Google Play,"It's addicting but feels cramped and messy because there are unnecessary elements like showing the profiles in replies, but it depicts friendliness, so it's good. And I feel like the elements are too close to each other. The app is great because there is no ads, spam, and free from toxic, yet. I hope they can keep the environment safe and toxic free.",4,2023-07-07 07:16:59
Google Play,"I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.",1,2023-07-11 21:58:36
Google Play,"I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc",3,2023-07-09 22:38:05
Google Play,"There's an annoying glitch that makes this app almost useless, whenever I change tab, such as from activity to feed or profile, their UI overlays on top of each other which makes reading anything is Impossible. I had to minimize and reopen the app in order to make the glitch gone, but only temporarily because the same issue will reappear if I try to change tab again. Please fix this!",1,2023-07-09 04:02:23
Google Play,"The application doesn't work and constantly says 'Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again'. This is frustrating. I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( Fix it, please.",1,2023-07-20 20:22:06
Google Play,"Interesting App, but somehow the user experience is kinda less user-friendly when already has a lot of users. The threads are mixed up, and it would be great if there is a setting option for an account owner only who can see the ""Replies"" tab instead of showing it publicly (without changing it into a private account). And somehow when I try to modify the settings and navigate back, it always redirects to Instagram App instead, not navigating back to the Threads app.",3,2023-07-06 05:17:10
Google Play,The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.,2,2023-07-22 20:20:32
Google Play,"Missing most basic yet most-desired features like saving media! It's intended to replace Twitter but lacks a simple save function for images and videos. People like to SHARE and people like to SAVE media. Every single person on the planet knows and understands this. It cannot and will NEVER replace Twitter as long as it is missing a feature everyone wants, period.",2,2023-07-09 00:24:16
Google Play,"So at the moment I have two issues with the app: the first is the feed - there needs to be an option for follow-only feed on something like that, something closer to the Instagram experience. The second issue is the crashes - I know this app is literally two days old but it crashed on me a few times already and it sucks. Other than that, works fine, nice app.",3,2023-07-07 14:01:17
Google Play,"Yes, the app is excellent. My experience with this app has been fantastic. I know it's a new challenge for Twitter. Here are my suggestions for the next update: 1. I highly recommend adding a scheduling feature. This would be incredibly useful for creators like me to plan and schedule their Threads in advance. 2. Another suggestion is to incorporate a direct messaging (DM) feature. This would enable users to have private conversations within the app.",4,2023-07-06 10:38:10
Google Play,Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.,3,2023-07-13 16:23:06
Google Play,"1-we need a trending list for every region, just like Twitter. So that people can know what's going around the world. 2-when posting pics or videos, it doesn't give us the option to choose from different folders like Twitter does. 3-when typing a long reply, the view doesn't automatically adjust to show what we're typing. Instead, we have to scroll up to see the rest of what we're typing.",3,2023-07-06 10:59:49
Google Play,Really needs a lot of improvement. It's a promising app. Hope you can fix the bugs. Add options to filter what we want to see in our home page. Add DM. Option to add more than one account just like in IG. It's frustrating to go back and forth. Oh well... Hope this app will improve.,2,2023-07-08 15:00:36
Google Play,"Very messy to use, filled with threads from irrelevant people, despite the data collection that meta has on all their apps which include health and fitness for some reason. This makes it extremely boring to use, as the algorithm doesn't appear to be able to show any of my interests that it has collected from instagram - seeing as the two apps share the same account. It would be better as part of the instagram app, such as reels, as a section inside there.",1,2023-07-07 00:20:59
Google Play,"Update: Threads cannot handle dark mode, and it is automatic. so after 9 p.m. it is impossible to use, at least on Android 9 ------- more than half the time, threads shows a garbled mess of letters on an Android phone. also, threads has no means to report this it sure would be nice if they had some sort of feature to send a picture and show them what it looks like, or simply have a way to message or report an app issue",1,2023-07-09 01:18:45
Google Play,"off to a great start. Obviously it's never gonna be a 5* app upon release, but so far my only gripe is that features which are planned for inclusion aren't there yet. Look forward to when this becomes a more rounded, 'complete' software product. Also, ability to save images would be nice.",3,2023-07-07 16:10:35
Google Play,"There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.",1,2023-07-11 14:12:19
Google Play,"It's a good app and has more restrictions than what Twitter has to offer, but after I transferred my Instagram data, I hadn't been able to open up my Instagram. When I do open, I can only stay on chats that I have been notified in, and if I navigated away from the chat, it crashes on me. I've uninstalled it for a little while, but it still doesn't work. I don't know if it's a thread thing, an Instagram thing, or both, but it started when I downloaded Thread.",3,2023-07-07 20:01:51
Google Play,"as of now, i've experienced a few bugs depending on which device i use threads on. on my tablet, everytime i try to post my art the entire app crashes. on my phone, everytime i try to post more than one photo the post reads something along the lines of ""post couldnt be uploaded"". although i do have hope for threads, its very simplistic and easy to use.",3,2023-07-08 18:41:10
Google Play,"The data collection on this app is SINISTER. The user agreement has the same function as Facebook where they literally own your images and content, and can use it commercially. Now I can't delete it without deleting my instagram! If you are an artist, avoid this app at all costs. Everyone else, go into your phone data alloance settings and turn off all data allowances for the app. It won't stop the data mining but it might help. Very dangerous for user security.",1,2023-07-08 11:30:31
Google Play,"The first day on the app has been really good- I haven't noticed any bad bugs or experienced any crashes. Please add a following-only feed and an option to view in chronological order. That would make the app so much better.

Google Play,"This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.",2,2023-07-12 16:53:45
Google Play,"Slow, glitchy, and constant crashes! Whenever we try to post something it always ends up in the limbo, garbage experience! Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.",1,2023-07-21 11:09:12
Google Play,"Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.",2,2023-07-13 06:14:43
Google Play,"Such a frustrating buggy experience. Looks promising for us photographers. No apparent restrictions on image size, crop or quality. But I cannot get it to load from within the app or share from my Pixel 7 folders. Weirdly it has just allowed me to post one image from my White border app. 🤷 Of the thousands of images I have to share it literally will only let me share this one image. Plus I experimented with sharing it again but the app refused and just closes. 🤦",1,2023-07-08 06:42:47
Google Play,"Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch.

Google Play,"Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says ""sorry something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken.

Unusable. Zuck lost.",1,2023-07-15 01:53:50
Google Play,"For now, only 3 stars! Can see potential in this app, but agree with some about a few improvements. I'd like to see 2 FEEDS! One the current random FEED... to view everything that's happening and connect with new people. And a 2nd FEED (maybe a TAB), that shows the people you already FOLLOW, showing their POSTs... making it quick'n simple at a glance to see what friends are doing. We don't all have time to browse content of a random FEED for POSTs made by those we choose to FOLLOW.",3,2023-07-07 07:29:08
Google Play,"Just got the app, tried three times to make a post, and it failed each time. Tried different formats, low character counts, etc. and all in perfect service. It just failed to post. Maybe I'll come back when the app is actually usable.",1,2023-07-08 22:24:39
Google Play,Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.,1,2023-07-10 04:11:59
Google Play,"As a starter this is okay but there are two deal breakers. One is the feed. You get stuff from accounts you don't follow and have no interest in and it cannot be changed. Second, if you log in with instagram, you can't change anything or deactivate profile on threads as it's synced. You have to change or just delete your entire instagram profile.",2,2023-07-07 01:53:24
Google Play,"- The UI is a bit clunky. Icons have really thick outlines that heavily compete with text visually. Lines between threads are too thin. - Video players are quite horrible. Sometimes audio never works, sometimes the video perpetually pauses on fullscreen / when tapping the thread. - Most threads I see are from accounts I don't follow. While I think that's good for discovering new accounts upon first launch, I don't see many threads from followed accounts.",3,2023-07-09 13:07:44

Google Play,"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.",4,2023-07-09 18:26:14
Google Play,"The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.",4,2023-07-16 13:38:55
Google Play,"It's a good app. You can share anything, especially your current thoughts and whatnots. However, I suggest that there should be a choice of interests too so that the contents on home will be filtered with that interest. It will be much more fun to use it if people see what they actually like to see. Hoping for the improvement of algorithms.",4,2023-07-06 13:23:41
Google Play,Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.,2,2023-07-12 15:00:49
Google Play,"Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads.

Apperantly it's USELESS APP... it has Good dark interface, but there are numerous issues 👉 it crashes often without error message, too slow to even update profile section, Can't even upload single image (despite there is with high speed broadband connection), copy paste doesn't work .. ""@"" function (in bio) doesn't work .. not sure if all these issues will get resolved. Otherwise I am going to uninstall it and stop using for forever.",1,2023-07-06 06:29:52
Google Play,"While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.",2,2023-07-06 09:19:02

Not impressed. Only using as I need to be across all social media but really not happy with my user experience on the first day of it going live, & don't like you have to tie it to the Instagram. I'd prefer it to be a standalone platform, it feels like you're being forced to put all your eggs in the Meta basket!",1,2023-07-06 10:08:49
Google Play,"The idea behind this app is great! It's quite convenient that it's connected to Insta account. However, experience with it can be improved. Majorly, by changing algorithms of feed to only view Threads of accounts you follow, or by adding a feature to filter your feed manually, to choose whose threads to see. Hope this feedback will be taken into account 🙏🙏🙏",3,2023-07-08 08:54:58
Google Play,"10/10 for the UI, it looks cool and clean. But the feed is just infested with suggested content. At least on twitter you can separate the suggested content from the content of entities that you actually choose to follow. Might have some interest in Threads if they implement this feature, but for now... Bai",3,2023-07-18 22:18:18
Google Play,"It's pretty much Facebook's version of Twitter. Unfortunately the app is unstable and lacks basic features find in its parents app, like switching accounts. Whenever I open ""threads"" (replies to a post within the app) the app will crash every other time. It's quite embarrassing to have the main feature bugged. The app is an unoriginal idea and it needs significant improvements. If it worked, could sort feed, switch accounts, and post audio, I'd give 4⭐ I'm using Oxygen OS 13.1 (OnePlus 10 Pro)",2,2023-07-07 11:41:35
Google Play,"This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.",2,2023-07-23 10:46:03
Google Play,"Good for early days, a bit glitchy and lots to build on still. In the middle of writing a post, the app closes down entirely and looses the content so I'm having to write it in my phone notes. If you write a long post, your phone keyboard is in the way as the Threads text box doesn't shift up the more you write, so you can't amend mistakes or text. I'm seeing a heck of a lot of posts from people I don't follow at all and have no interest in. A familiar, simple app though so I like it so far.",3,2023-07-09 09:58:25
Google Play,"Terrible in terms of privacy and lacking many essential features, such as a timeline for just those you follow. By using this (and other Meta apps too) you are giving away basically almost everything about you to a company with a horrible track record when it comes to properly handling user data.

I can't save images 4. can't 2x tap to zoom image, I must pinch it to zoom and it's doesn't stay still zooming the image, it always goes back to original size. 5.

I really hope it gets better.",2,2023-07-07 03:17:50
Google Play,"Going on two weeks since public launch now and this app is starting to suffer from lack of very common features (which honestly should have been standard at launch).

FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.",2,2023-07-13 13:53:48
Google Play,"Worthless so far. I have no idea what the feed is doing. It's not showing me any of the accounts that I follow, and the rare one I do see the post is 20 hours old. There's no way to sort by suggested, followed, most recent, personal lists, anything. There's no hashtags, no way to really search for the content I want to follow. Hurry up and get on adding more features to make this thing functional.",1,2023-07-23 18:28:10

Google Play,"The app looks promising and at its initial stage that's why there are some complicated parts of it but I do suggest some features such as, messaging feature just like in Instagram; photo cropping and editing feature when posting a picture; circles would also be good; and lastly, ability to look at someone's profile picture.

Google Play,"Off to a great start! This is a great alternative to other text-based social media! After installing I could import my Instagram profile pic, bio and followed accounts (some of whom are already on the new app).

My only suggestion is I would like to see a more compact timeline UI or the ability to customize the size of posts so I can read more Threads per screen 😀",5,2023-07-06 17:11:26

Google Play,Wish I'd done more research before downloading this app. Feed is filled with posts from people I don't follow and it's impossible to find posts from people I do. Now I can't delete it or Meta will also delete my Instagram account so that's how they trap you into keeping it. Turning off all notifications on this app and just won't use it since it's junk. Wish there was an option for zero stars!,1,2023-07-07 20:48:16

Google Play,For now I give it 2 stars since the app interface just acting weirdly. Looks like the screen is gllitching all the time whenever I tried to scroll. Maybe because it's quite new app. Hopefully it got fixed soon. It's annoying to not be able to do anything.,2,2023-07-07 00:32:08

I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.,1,2023-07-12 10:13:12
Google Play,"It's interesting so far, but a lot of us use desktop way more than mobile apps. It took a long time for Instagram to figure that out, but they finally gave a half-assed desktop version.

Google Play,"It's decent thus far, it definitely needs a translate thread feature, you can't search keywords and there's no tags to find specific things, so there's no real way to 'grow' except for finding your friends on the app. You can post pictures and videos, quote threads and repost threads. There's no DM system, which is fair enough. I do expect the app to get better in coming updates, but for now it's kind of lacking.",3,2023-07-06 22:45:23

Google Play,"Not bad app, it does have less features than twitter (like polls and desktop site), but more stuff is probably going to be added one day. I'm just happy that people can (kinda) see my threads without having to pay a subscription. Though, I have a few annoyances. Like paid verification. That's Twitter's thing. I get that it has the ID stuff but still, can you at least make it where if you have alot of followers you can get verified without the fee??",4,2023-07-08 21:52:45
Google Play,It's a good app for spending some of your time without losing the track of time and waste more time like in Instagram and YouTube. It is starting so it is not perfect I think it should have reel s and all plus it should have personalized content because a lot of content I see on thread I don't even care about so they could improve this with updates. It is smooth and not laggy like Twitter with which it is competing. But privacy is a problem because meta is not good privacy,4,2023-07-09 03:57:06
Google Play,"Only one account? So much for businesses being able to use it. It's 2023, you would think that this feature would be one of the first things added.

Google Play,It's only just launched so I think we should give it a chance to grow but there's virtually no customization. You can't limit your feed to only accounts you follow and you can't create or filter your own feed via hashtags or keywords. This makes for a very bland and homogenized platform. The feed feels disorganized and strewn together with things I don't care about and don't find interesting. I would much prefer something that could be configured and adjusted to my own tastes.,3,2023-07-06 04:37:56
Google Play,"Worst experience 😭😔, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads 😞, the app has some bugs to be fixed.

Google Play,"The app is very interesting and I personally really like it. I hope that more new features will be added in the future.

Google Play,"It's clearly rolled out in a haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profiles which we can toggle between on Instagram.

I like it so far , but there are some points need to be fixed . 1- i follow Arabic and English content in my account, but the alignment is bad , if put the app language is English, the Arabic content will be a chaos and vice versa . 2- waiting for the follow and hashtags features, I'm ready to give it 5 stars after these points fixed .",3,2023-07-07 10:14:35

Google Play,"3 stars for now. It may go up or down depending on future updates. I love that it's, so far, ad free, that it's easy to use and not as toxic as twitter(although I fully expect that to change). As simple as twitter. Imo, it needs an option to only see posts from those you follow, also a topic or group section where we can join current trending topics or interests we have, which is also a great way to follow others and pick up followers who are like-minded.",3,2023-07-08 09:47:32

Google Play,"My honest review, is that how it is and the idea they have of the app is perfect, following threads and about conversation. I don't think it needs DMs, and Livestream. ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.",4,2023-07-07 05:54:39
Google Play,"Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ...

Google Play,"Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions.

Google Play,"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface",5,2023-07-11 20:09:12
Google Play,"1. Although no ads in threads, but too much algorithmic content on feed which I don't really like. 2. You have to login with your Instagram account. You cannot create new account by email or phone number. 3. Once you created threads account you cannot delete it. If you want to delete, then you have to delete your Instagram account as well because threads account is interlinked with Instagram. 4. There is nothing new UI & UX. Looks like Twitter. Almost same UI. 5. No Chat option. No Hashtag",1,2023-07-07 06:28:33
Google Play,"The home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.",1,2023-07-07 19:30:44
Google Play,"Yes, it's a new app. But Meta is not exactly an indie developer! There is literally no reason to be flooding us with Rando Accounts. That should have been basic functionality from Day 1. But like Instagram, seems Threads just wants to push random posts on us whether we like it or not. Until basic functions are in, I'll be sticking with Twitter.",2,2023-07-09 07:33:06
Google Play,"""Something went wrong please try again"". Get this message all the time. Can't see replies, my profile and many other features. This message just pops up all the time. Also people I follow don't show up at the top of my feed. I get random recommendations at top. Back to Twitter until sorted.",1,2023-07-17 08:44:38
Google Play,You cannot delete it unless you delete your instagram account too. The deep integration with instagram is perverse. It could have been a standalone app that does not require you to plug in into the metaverse by force but I guess that was asking too much.,3,2023-07-06 09:07:02
Google Play,"If there was less random stuff on feed, it would be a lot better, or if there was some way to organize it where you have a following feed and a for you feed. There's just too much random stuff.",2,2023-07-06 19:25:05
Google Play,"Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words only",4,2023-07-11 02:03:36
Google Play,"Threads is a fantastic new app that enhances the Instagram experience and revolutionizes private messaging. It seamlessly integrates with Instagram, allowing users to stay connected with their closest friends and share moments in a more intimate and personalized way. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate User Shree_Morbekar",5,2023-07-06 20:50:42
Google Play,"PLEASE make it so you can separate your followers from the suggested algorithm stuff, it's so hard to find the content i ACTUALLY want to to see. this would be the first thing that should be updated/added. I don't like using it that much because of that",2,2023-07-07 06:15:58
Google Play,"First and foremost, the user interface of Threads is beautifully designed and user-friendly. Navigating through the app is a breeze, with intuitive controls and a clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The app's attention to detail in terms of aesthetics is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall user experience",5,2023-07-09 18:35:21

Google Play,"All the things are quite well but where the edit button i the app? On starting the the app, it's previous refreshes remains on display. But after shaking for report, it becomes normal, no lag, no glitch.! What's the matter?",4,2023-07-07 04:22:08
Google Play,"Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see. The app has potential but they rushed the launch. I'll give them a couple weeks to add some more features but right now there is no benefit for general users.",1,2023-07-18 14:23:16
Google Play,"App keeps crashing. If i scroll for a while or while writing a thread, it crashes. If i am responding to a thread which has a vertical photo/video, i cannot see what i am typing. It seems as if interns have made this app.",2,2023-07-08 07:17:23
Google Play,"Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.",2,2023-07-10 14:25:47
Google Play,Why can't my name be name (not app nickname or whatever) be different than the one on my Instagram account. I use these apps for different reasons. What's even the point of this if it's just the same stuff as Instagram? Also I want to be able to view threads in chronological order and have the app save my spot when I leave it and come back. I don't want to be a slave to your mediocre algorithm.,1,2023-07-08 04:50:18
Google Play,"The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.",1,2023-07-10 14:36:42
Google Play,"Not bad works great on my fold 4, but when switching between the displays, it asks to restart the app. It should handel multiple screens better than this. Still, it's better than Elon's crapwitter!",4,2023-07-07 19:30:51
Google Play,Very weird and bad. My feed is full of randoms who confuse me and I don't care about anything they ever want to post. Lack most basic features like DMs and requires insane amount of private data. Also needs Instagram account and can't be removed without removing both accounts.,1,2023-07-08 19:35:38
Google Play,It is a wonderful app. But I think tbey can still do better concerning picture uploading. Like I have to scroll through thousands of pictures to find the one I want to upload. It can be very frustrating.,3,2023-07-07 02:27:49
Google Play,"It has a constant visual bug on my device where the app's background gets smeared with whatever content is being displayed on the foreground, and it doesn't refresh back to black. ROG 2, Android 9",1,2023-07-09 00:16:03
Google Play,"Ik this is just the first day of its launch but I don't really like the formate here. I feel like I'm stuck in the same place that feels sofficating on the main page, and I can't see much of the content that I've followed and had to refollow the creators again. Congrats on the launched of the app, but hopefully this will change soon so the app will be much better than how it is now.",3,2023-07-06 06:55:00
Google Play,A very lonely app if you don't already have several instagram followers. I would also appreciate a photo album option as I have 8000 photos on my phone and can't scroll through them all. I get that it's brand new but it seems very unfinished.,2,2023-07-07 21:06:20
Google Play,"I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.",3,2023-07-09 20:19:12
Google Play,"It has minimal UI and a typical user flow. There is a bug, though. When I try to upload images in the following thread, it shuts. I tried removing from recents, reinstalled, but stayed the same.",3,2023-07-11 07:55:21
Google Play,"Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.",4,2023-07-12 04:13:53
Google Play,This Applications interface is shuttering when I use to refresh the page and also it don't responded as I can expect. I thing it needs to improve their interfacen !! Yes I was very excited to use this app but it didn't work in my phone. Is it running fine with your device ?,1,2023-07-06 10:56:02
Google Play,"Lot of space to improve. Would love to have a much more advanced options to post a thread (text styling etc.), and a view that seperate people you follow and fyp. Need the save image and video button. Need the time mark in video player. Just experienced crashing when I go beyond a reply to a reply in a thread, hope yall will fix that ASAP. Need save button, hashtags and embed. For messages just link insta... Please don't seperate it. Need the option to choose what we see from a person we follow.",3,2023-07-07 10:17:46
Google Play,"Writing after day 1, it's about as smooth a launch as it could've hoped for. I am however having a problem where if I search for users too much (as one looking for accounts to follow will do), the search breaks and doesn't fix itself. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a rate limit. It fixed after reinstallation but only once. I hope and expect more features will be added to the app in short order, too. E.g. DMs, customized account lists, Web version. Default home feed should be different.",5,2023-07-07 07:49:55
Google Play,I feel like there's room for more features. Like the dark and light mode. One should be able to save pictures and also choose whether to auto play videos or not,3,2023-07-07 09:43:49
Google Play,"Threads needs a search feature for content. The search bar only searches for accounts. People should be able to use the search bar to find thread topics. If you want to see what's being said about a show or person, you should be able to search keywords to pull content related to your search. The app feels unusable without that simple feature.",2,2023-07-06 21:16:58
Google Play,"There's no option to disable Reels or videos autoplay on the app. This is the major reason why I don't use Instagram, its parent app. Too many unnecessary Reels or videos will consume a lot of data. I thought this would be different from Instagram, but it's all the same. I hate the autoplay.",1,2023-07-06 17:58:59
Google Play,"It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.",2,2023-07-11 16:12:41

Google Play,"Sorry only two stars however gotta admit the app has huge potential but you need to do two things, first get rid of the annoying celebrities and influencers and brands that i don't follow nor any of the people on my following list interacted with from my timeline, second you need to disconnect the app from instagram or at least make the link between the two optional.",2,2023-07-07 15:48:03

Google Play,"I like it, but the content us not sorted chronologically, so I keep seeing posts from two days ago mixed with more recent posts. Also, lots of post from corporations, celebrities and influencers keep being shown in the timeline (if we can call it like that), so I spend all my time muting and blocking, because those marketing agency contents are annoying to see.",4,2023-07-08 01:48:05
Google Play,"I am a big fan of this application. I've been getting tired of all the changes Elon has done to twitter. There is still a very steep growth curve, but im very excited. There are two features that I feel like would be really helpful to improve user experience. 1) as im writing my threads, if I exceed the number of threads my screen allows, I am unable to scroll down to see what im writing as my keyboard is blocking the view, and threads doesn't allow to scroll down. 2) threads scheduler!",4,2023-07-08 12:55:15

Google Play,"When I log into Threads, I automatically log out from Instagram and vice versa. There is no option to see posts only from accounts I follow. There is no option for posts that I am NOT INTERESTED in. It is new, and people like new things, but let me just say it, there is a huge need for improvement.",2,2023-07-08 05:51:08
Google Play,"Keeps closing when typing. I'm using a Huawei P30 and it just closes when typing, more often when typing @ then a name but it's mega frustrating. I'm giving it a 3 because of this. Otherwise it's a fantastic new app and the absence of DMs is an absolute winner and game changer.",3,2023-07-10 05:57:31
Google Play,"The amount of data this app requires from users is absurd. And the fact that you can't delete your threads account without deleting your instagram is horrible! The app itself is mainly text. If you're joining as a Twitter alternative, don't bother. You can't even search posts. There are no hashtags. I already want to delete threads just because of the extreme data mining. Europe has blocked it for those exact reasons.",1,2023-07-06 12:29:54
Google Play,"Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.",2,2023-07-14 16:30:46
Google Play,Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.,1,2023-07-18 17:55:36
Google Play,"This app would've been a better version of Twitter but if one wants to delete the account, they need to delete their Instagram too. This is the worst implemention a company could have brought. Deactivating does not include your Instagram but still, you should be able to delete your account without deleting Instagram! At least this information needs to be in the registiration page OR the description of the app.",1,2023-07-06 15:58:18
Google Play,"Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.",5,2023-07-12 12:25:26
Google Play,One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that,4,2023-07-10 06:31:32
Google Play,"Everything else is OK , but When you go to gallery you have no option for going to your photo albums.

Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out",2,2023-07-11 05:18:29
Google Play,"I want my video muted for private reasons and i hope insta/meta devs can make it slightly bigger so that i avoid pressing the video when pressing the unmute button, i hate it when it happens becoz the video gets enlarge, i like the auto play feature while scrolling, the mute/unmute button is just my problem. So i rate it 4/5, so far so good it feels like a new home, a new space to breath, new people to meet, internet feels new again. Thank you Instagram! Thank you Meta!",4,2023-07-06 16:22:29
Google Play,"I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.",2,2023-07-18 06:32:06
Google Play,"Definitely still enjoying this low stress and low drama experience on day 2. It has room to grow and improve, and a rollout of new features will help to retain users, but for something in its infancy, it's pretty great.",5,2023-07-06 17:21:39
Google Play,"It's okay. But I hope it has an option to simply switch account. Just like in IG where I can just double tap the profile icon then it switches. In threads, I need to logout first then switch account which is quite frustrating.",3,2023-07-07 14:57:45
Google Play,"I like the app, however there are some glitches and recommendations I have. For one, the reply function seems to be finicky, it on occasion force shuts down the app when I am trying to reply to a post (a thread?). Another recommendation is discoverability, I would love a tab where you can discover new people and what they're saying. Like a community or discover page, also a trending tab with news and the sorts would boost engagement.",4,2023-07-07 12:04:30

Google Play,"Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for Twitter",2,2023-07-11 15:57:39
Google Play,"I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads.

Google Play,"Nice app. But when I try to load a picture on my Threads draft, the app shuts down. I mean, it just closes 🤷‍♀️ Tried like another 20 times, but once I select a picture and click done, app closes. That's scary because I've lost hardwritten drafts because of that.",3,2023-07-07 06:13:09
Google Play,"I used to be a user few months ago and this was just like messenger. When I downloaded this again today, I hoped they would've saved the messaging option. It's a good app for the rivalry but I didn't expect them to completely remove the originality of the app. I hope the future updates of this app will consist a mixture of the old threads and the new one so we can DM the people along w this new sick update. Until then, I'll be using old version of this app just for my DMs lol.",3,2023-07-07 13:07:27

Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?",2,2023-07-07 13:00:46
Google Play,I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.,1,2023-07-24 00:52:03

Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed.

Google Play,I really like it!! Though I have a suggestion that could really help a lot of us users. Please add another option for following where we could only see the threads of the person we follow. I really don't like my feed as it's really messy and too much people I don't follow.

It needs some improvements like adding hashtags and separating the following threads from those accounts you don't follow, you know, just like in Twitter. and it's hard to make an account.

Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning.

Google Play,"I like the concept of the app, but I'm having issues with my timeline, it's not showing me the accounts I follow, no matter how many times I refresh the timeline, it shows me random accounts that I don't follow, and it's not because the users I do follow are reposting their threads, it's just giving me random accounts. I want to see the accountsI follow, I specifically didn't tap the ""follow all"" button when setting up my account because I wanted to follow specific people. Please fix this issue",2,2023-07-07 02:45:39
Google Play,Pretty well to navigate. A little hard to branch off to find similar users. But my biggest hate and the reason why I give 3 stars is the constant spam of verified users that I don't care about.

Google Play,Pretty mid - concept is cool for those who basically want a PG/clean version of Twitter. Doesn't have direct messaging so no chance of strangers trying to scam you or sending you porn. But it links to your Instagram account so you can't delete your threads profile without deleting your Instagram profile too. Hopefully this mechanism will be scrapped and soon else I can see the app crashing and burning. But you can however deactivate the threads account without it impacting your Instagram.,3,2023-07-07 15:47:37

Google Play,I will give 3 stars for now since it was just released recently.

I hope there will be an update soon for controlling your newsfeed and improve users' interface.,3,2023-07-06 04:30:59
Google Play,This is honestly one of the best apps ever. I am glad this doesnt have adds. One suggestion i would like is that when a person you follow repots something- there should be an icon that will notify you instead of having to go to their profile.

Google Play,Needs work. The algorithm curated timeline only shows me two or three things from people I follow before switching to random things from strangers I'm not interested in.

Google Play,Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart.

Google Play,"Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic",4,2023-07-09 19:54:00
Google Play,"This is the beginning of something big. But I think there's somethings missing on the platform that will make it more user friendly. such as; 1. ""Trending news"" lemme name it as ""Trend Threads"" 2. For android users too we can't go through the albums of your gallery, you just have to scroll till u get to the media you would love to ""Thread"" 3. There is no ""hashtags"" Please fix them for us e trust you 👍💯🙌",4,2023-07-07 12:27:25
Google Play,"Installed the app. Then, I couldn't even create an account. You can only log in with your Instagram account. I neither have nor want an Instagram account. I was hoping this would be a viable alternative to Twitter, but I guess not. Great job Zuckerberg, you really missed an opportunity here.",1,2023-07-06 18:28:04
Google Play,"Terrible. Because of Instagram's overly cautious account policy, I think Instagram itself treats Threads as a 3rd party app and because of it I've been getting constantly logged out of Threads as well as Instagram despite they are designed as intertwined apps. This is such a huge failure on Meta's part yet again. Please fire the development team of Instagram and stop with overly cautious log in policies.",1,2023-07-07 07:33:51

Google Play,"This app is awesome already, but I do have a few suggestions. First, you should be able to like a thread when it's shared to an Instagram story, either by having it redirect to the threads app or straight from the Instagram app. Second, you gotta make it to where you can search for threads using keywords. Instagram has hashtags, so you could even let me search using those. Dodge and weave those lawsuits ! 😛🤔🧨😈",4,2023-07-06 22:54:46
Google Play,"Not working, as soon i touch ut to scroll it a little, it washes the screen with words like when you scroll very fast and never stops just have to close the app then.",1,2023-07-11 08:20:38
Google Play,Wow! I can't believe. This is really a fantastic and user-friendly application from Meta. Perfect application for Instagram users. Meta really satisfied us with this gorgeous application. Just gorgeous! Highly recommend it.,5,2023-07-08 05:11:28
Google Play,"Pleasantly surprised, I actually am enjoying it. Gave up on Twitter a while back and seems like this is an easy to use alternative. Not perfect, but it's brand new so I expect that. Give it a try (and delete twitter!)",5,2023-07-08 04:26:40
Google Play,"Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for. Feed is full of algorithm-chosen randos, can't limit it just to the people you follow, it's a privacy nightmare (read what it ties to your account), you can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account, and no sign of the Mastodon integration.",1,2023-07-06 13:33:49
Google Play,"It's full of spam of accounts I don't follow and are not even related to the ones I do, is extremely annoying to a post of one of my friends and another 20 of strangers, blocking and reporting should be easier and once done should automatically mute that person's threads, and above all is no dark theme, so far not liking it at all",1,2023-07-08 14:48:01

Google Play,"Smooth very nice. I have suggestion, please add hashtag search, so we can find others thread whos using those hashtags. And maybe link? With the device browser popup, dont use threads browser popup itself, So we can easily login or approving login api's when connecting on something.

Google Play,"For a version #1 , this is a fantastic app. Needs some more features to make it a daily app for me, such as chronological view of posts from only my followers vs an algorithm that is now feeding me NFL and MLB and other posts that I have no interest in.",5,2023-07-06 23:27:03
Google Play,I have never liked Twitter UI and it's interfacing and now after using threads it's really app that can replace Twitter because in Twitter the pages load times are too slow and it's unreliable too. Thread is great 👍.,4,2023-07-06 10:34:39
Google Play,"Pretty decent UI so far, but checking other people's profiles take a bit before they load. But overall, it's a pretty decent experience. It's not as filled as Twitter content-wise, but it will get there soon enough.",5,2023-07-06 10:46:00
Google Play,Having rendering issue.. the app opens well but the moment I tried to scroll everything collapses ... It like every text overlap with each other.. How to fix it ??,1,2023-07-07 05:02:50
Google Play,"Without a proper search function I don't see why this would even claim to contend with Twitter. It took me 10 minutes to lose interest. Might be useful for following friends and idols, but then why another app. Meta has a bunch of them.",2,2023-07-08 19:15:44
Google Play,"While the app is a good one,I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!",2,2023-07-10 10:48:18
Google Play,Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread 🧵. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨,2,2023-07-10 11:32:56
Google Play,Looks clean for now but it has lots of bugs like when to try to increase or decrease the volume of a video it's doesn't work if you refresh sometimes app creashes feed refresh is very slow.. but hope it improves,2,2023-07-06 11:35:27
Google Play,"Great app, Inside a thread need to minimise padding between 2 threads, overall the whole theme seems to be too much dark, can add other tones as well like Green, red, blue to create some dynamic feels. Overall Great app",4,2023-07-06 14:11:31
Google Play,App is very unstable. The words in an entire screen mesh in the worse way possible once I scroll down through the threads. Can't even read anything,2,2023-07-07 02:39:09
Google Play,Works well and is good looking but as a competitor of Twitter lacks functionalities. The search function is useless except for finding people. And I am not getting suggested threads based on my interests. The app is too basic atm.,3,2023-07-09 06:30:05
Google Play,fold 4 english review: works ok on fold but locks into only 1 oriantion when on the inner screen. when using it in dex complains that some dex features will not work. general thoughts: instagram with option of only text posts? there is no # hashtag searching. no searching for topics. as a social app its kind of hard to be... social.,4,2023-07-06 04:10:55
Google Play,"Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. When I hit play on videos the sound doesn't play.",4,2023-07-09 21:50:00
Google Play,This app is a great throw back to old school Twitter. Highly recommend this over Twitter now. The algorithm shows you things you want to see versus Twitter which shows you paid users first. Over all and exciting challenge to Twitter that I'm all too happy because part of. You also cannot pay your way to being seen over others making it more fair than twitters current system.,4,2023-07-08 17:41:54
Google Play,Well Great Execution may be a copy 2 Twitter but looks quite intresting... Of course some developments yet 2 b done like - 1) Increase d word limit in bio coloumn 2) It takes lot of time 2 post any thread 3) Multiple options in COLOUR & FONT makes more attractive,5,2023-07-08 03:09:12

Google Play,"Idk if the app has an issue or if it's something else but I know people I have been following have been making posts and I do not get any mobile notifications about anything related to this app at all, other than that first impressions of this app is it's pretty decent for using it for only an hour plus no rate limit is nice 😂. Fix the mobile notifications or help with making them pop up and we're good to go here!",4,2023-07-06 01:23:43
Google Play,"Meh, there is a lot of other threads that i have scroll past to find people I follow. Adding those accounts to the block list doesn't diminish the amount of unwanted theads. The plus side is that if you have a pretty extensive sponsored ads block list in IG, that was carried over.",1,2023-07-10 22:06:01
Google Play,so far so good. the app has been running very smooth since day one for me. there's still more features that should be implemented but overall pretty solid.,5,2023-07-08 01:48:05
Google Play,"Not somethings I would expect from a giant like Meta. I'm aware that the app has been out for literally 2 days but all the contents of the screen started glitching as soon as I got to the ""home feed"". I can provide more information if the dev team is interested.",1,2023-07-06 15:59:57
Google Play,Overall a good experience and I think it has the most potential for getting Twitter's place. A quick feature request: - Please add RTL languages support.,5,2023-07-06 08:50:37
Google Play,"The app sucks. The navigation is terrible, as if you were on a poorly-designed web site. It also sucks that threads dot net cannot be browsed like Twitter or Mastodon or Reddit or etc. Please stop pretending that Threads is not a web site and that your app is not just a half-a§§ed web browser.",2,2023-07-08 22:38:57
Google Play,I like it a lot. Especially in terms of a clean UI. But maybe if you can make multiple account choices and also the Pin feature,3,2023-07-06 12:22:24
Google Play,Add auto translate since an app like this is more likely to letting people from different countries socialize with each other. Just keep improving! I'm boutta leave the other app cuz they ask for money to get extra features. 🥲,5,2023-07-07 16:04:02
Google Play,"This app has filled up my timeline with profiles I don't even follow! It defeats the whole purpose of ""following""🗑️ I'm going back to twitter. If this is not changed, I'm deleting the app altogether. Nonsense!",1,2023-07-19 17:01:18
Google Play,Hope there's more option to access my media like using my phone's integrated albums app. It's kinda hard to add older media since I have to scroll down my whole gallery.,4,2023-07-06 05:41:25
Google Play,"Just new face behind other! 1 . Its just a new look behind insta . 2. All apps r attached to each other, fb and insta . 3.

U cannot log in through google. And it cause u to make a new profile, after making it, it says passwore incorrect or user not found. 5. Alot more needs to develop. I cannot restore my fb accoun.",2,2023-07-18 09:50:48

Google Play,Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.,5,2023-07-13 01:42:55

Google Play,"I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.",1,2023-07-20 22:05:08

Google Play,"Doesn't even work anymore, it was fine for about a week but at some point I could no longer see my own profile or activity, it just says ""something went wrong"" I reported it but that black box of a user support system doesn't even inform me if the report went through and no reinstalling the app didn't work",1,2023-07-19 23:57:16
Google Play,It's quiet pleasant. I really hope you are open for more improvements such as a button for media so we can see our photos/videos related posts. Or likes button so we can see our liked posts. Also I hope you add hashtag feature for the future improvements.,5,2023-07-06 08:30:16

Google Play,"Don't know how to say about this application. Similar to ""The Blue Bird""🤣🤣🤣🤣 but the difference that I found is No direct message and No Hashtag.

From what I can tell, the main draw for a lot of people is the simplistic interface, and how clean and refreshing it feels to not be bogged down by engagement. PLEASE KEEP THAT.

Google Play,"Extremely basic, lacks the most simple (and often most important) features an app of this category should have. Half the app is mangled together with IG, you can't really personalize your profile, it's slow, has the same policies as IG, isn't privacy friendly, doesn't have a chronological feed and some of the very few options it does have simply don't work. The only pros I could find is that it looks pretty and is relatively organized, but it doesn't come close to the competitor. 3/10",2,2023-07-06 19:10:13

Google Play,"It's a great start! I do feel like when adding photos we should have the ability to choose what album we pick from bc I have a ton of images on my phone and scrolling to hunt for them in 10k images isn't fun. Also I feel like there should be in app DMs as that's part of what makes things like Twitter so usable the ability to talk to our friends about threads or post. To what I DO love is the ability to add more than four photos at a time, the ability to write long multi post threads.",4,2023-07-07 00:40:24

Google Play,"I'm currently using my Lenovo Tab 4 8 to join Threads. At first, the UI seems it's not optimised for my tablet, it's just glitched out and can't read any threads, making it unusable. I think the UI is only optimised for phones, and not tablets. I guess I'll be using the web version of Threads (if it's available) until you fix the UI. Also, Threads functions like that one bird app where everyone is literally angry about, and yes, Threads is like an alternative to that app!",2,2023-07-08 01:28:07

Currently, I'm VERY CONFUSED.",2,2023-07-06 14:31:36
Google Play,"The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..",4,2023-07-12 01:16:11
Google Play,"100% unusable, the posts and texts on the timeline overlaps (like constantly scrolling & overlapping the post like hundred times) make it not even readable.

Anyway, completely inoperable, uninstall immediately.",1,2023-07-08 13:46:12
Google Play,"I know it's a new app but I think the feed needs a more variety of posts, maybe we can choose what interests we have so we can see what we want, it's full of verified users on the feed so it feels boring to scroll.

Google Play,Lack of accessibility options. Lack of clear search filters. Lot of accounts I don't follow in the feed. Not clear how it works or decides what to show who but I see almost 0 from people I follow and almost 100% of everything I don't follow. It's great as a Twitter alternative and even better than Twitter but it could use a bit of clarity to figure out how to connect with other interests and accounts.

Google Play,"Really not that good. It seems like it was released before it was ready. Very unintuitive. Accounts blocked on Instagram still have easy access on Threads.

Google Play,"It's not quite ready to launch yet, I had download/install this app as soon it came out so far so good nothing Hasn't been crashing, and etc yet but after few days give it like 2 days for it to start crashing and etc. But I had deleted the app to see would it stop but I don't know if it would. But I gotta feeling it's a problem with the software. And it started to crash today like I can't thread a post but it doesn't show a like when I had liked a threads but I can't comment on their threads.",1,2023-07-08 21:04:26
Google Play,"It's engaging and interactive. Since the app is still in its development phase, I won't comment on that. However, I wonder if there is any chance that our Instagram and Threads account could be independent of each other in future. Lots (like me) might have two different accounts on Instagram - maybe one for pictures, another being content specific (poetry, photography etc).

Google Play,This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.,1,2023-07-13 12:59:09
Google Play,"It's a twitter killer app, it's kinda fancy but then its major downside is its limitation to the Close Friends list, potentially restricting the user’s reach. Also, as a separate app, it might require users to switch between main Instagram and Thread apps to access the full range of Instagram features. So to me it's a 4star app",4,2023-07-06 12:06:56

Google Play,"Overall it's a good idea, but I hate that it only has a for you page (so you have to see everyone's posts, not just those you follow), and that your account cannot be deleted unless you delete your Instagram account, too. And once you link your ig account, you can't change your name, username, picture, or bio unless you change it on instagram. It'd be a much more enjoyable app if the two weren't so tightly connected and if you weren't forced to see posts from people you don't like or care about",1,2023-07-07 12:21:28

I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.",1,2023-07-11 21:56:49

Google Play,"Wanted to spite Elongated Muskrat, instead forced to sign up for Instagram just to log in, instead of just a regular sign in prompt, not even a Facebook or Google sign in option.

Google Play,As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.,1,2023-07-10 05:39:30

Google Play,This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?,1,2023-07-24 02:57:00

Google Play,This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.,1,2023-07-12 14:31:08

Google Play,Create your own Lists is Not a Feature. Only Following permitted makes this like Other New Social Platforms. It's Limiting & Not Convenient like Twitter for Grouping Numerous Topics & User Sources to review Easily. Meta obviously linked Threads Platform with Instagram quickly with little Value of Users regarding Lists. Is Follow Only better for Digital Data Capitalism? Hopefully it will Evolve. Does Threads have Follow Limit like Twtr for Users with Few Followers which having Lists increases?,2,2023-07-06 21:38:08

Technically this app ain't working perfectly, full of glitches, wha it should be as there was nothing new in it.

Google Play,Just another replicated version of Twitter and Instagram. Didn't find the app really exciting or anything new Plus seems the competition was only to prove who has fastest account holder which mera have achieved successfully offcourse by their marketing strategy through Instagram. Else won't recommend the app to anyone Just another TIME WASTING MACHINE which forces you to retain your account and cannot be deleted willingly. #privacyconcern,1,2023-07-07 07:18:58

Google Play,Uninstalled due to being forced into having to make a Facebook account just to make Instagram account just to make a threads account.. stupid! Shouldn't need all that unnecessary rubbish! The app should be it's own separate thing.. not having to sign in by using another apps..,1,2023-07-13 22:48:49

Google Play,Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.,2,2023-07-10 11:32:18
Google Play,This app isn't so bad for a first launch but there could be improvements like longer videos and no glitches also this app is way better than Twitter because with twitter you can't get as much as you can with Threads plus you can't see who your following or add city and state plus add category or contact options like Instagram otherwise than that this is a great app,3,2023-07-23 21:42:53

Google Play,"No point using since I can't customise what I see on my feed. I don't want to see all the possible posts from the multi-verse, only from who I follow. I have zero interest in sports, don't follow anybody in sports, so that showing up is an instant uninstall.",1,2023-07-09 04:28:50
Google Play,"Boring, wish i never downloaded it cause i can't delete my acc without deleting my IG, Facebook ( meta now ) as always never bring something new on the table since 2014, high expectations just tl find myself in a boring cheap version of Twitter ~ at least be a little creative with your apps and stop copying other apps to stay relevant ( Snapchat - TikTok - telegram - Twitter) and get us something new that may get our attention",1,2023-07-09 01:28:41
Google Play,stop trying to use an algorithm to guess what content I want to see and just let me view posts from people I follow. Twitter is a nightmare and it still allows me to do this. it was bad when you did it to Instagram and it is still bad.,1,2023-07-08 14:11:00
Google Play,I was super excited but you can't sign up for a new account you must use an Instagram account. It claims you only need an email but once you are done creating your account it immediately requires a phone number or it just freezes.,1,2023-07-06 02:43:30
Google Play,Good potential but too buggy and not enough features to be useful. Will come back when they've had time to sort things out.,2,2023-07-12 07:22:39
Google Play,I feel like this is just a copy of Twitter with nothing new or sepcial and it's even worse.. I literally downloaded it just because three of my favourite content creators are on it. You didn't even try to make new designs or buttons or features like what is this?,1,2023-07-07 22:51:32
Google Play,"Once upon a time, this app had the swagger of a superstar, but now it's just begging for a standing ovation from the exit door.

Google Play,"Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.",1,2023-07-11 16:51:43
Google Play,Very easy to use. Can you add download button to image in every user threads? Because somehow we want to save the image they sent to us. Overall is great!,5,2023-07-07 01:26:35
Google Play,"The app is good over all, needs alot of festures but since its just new, its understandable. What i didnt like on this app is that, if you dont have that much followers on your instagram account, youll get zero engagements on your posts. Its very hard to grow your account and i dont know if its based on luck but its really hard. I posted consistently everyday, got no effect.",3,2023-07-08 10:50:13

Google Play,Doesn't work as a stand alone platform. Wasn't interested in getting Instagram but to use this you must have an Instagram account and then if you don't like it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account too. No thanks.,1,2023-07-07 00:42:25
Google Play,Why its connected with Instagram.. i installed it and open account from insta. Now this thread badge is shown up in insta's bio. I Removed it many times from there..but its again shown on page refresh. Please do this app independently from insta...or i uninstall both the app..🙂,1,2023-07-12 03:13:23

Google Play,Dire. Installed and uninstalled because the flow of it isn't upto scratch. You get random posts in your feed. The data collection is very bad and intrusive,2,2023-07-16 20:10:36
Google Play,I downloaded & found it requires an Instagram account so just another gateway to an app i dont want. Twitter at least was stand alone but its policy on needing a mobile number puts me off using it. So Ill just stick to meeting mates for a drink & having real conversations with out enriching billionaires further.,1,2023-07-07 06:58:18
Google Play,Well i use Facebook the most and Instagram sometimes but they both have the same passwords and I was on this new app earlier and now it's saying my password is incorrect.. so I'll just stick with Facebook I guess. Wasn't a huge fan of Twitter or Instagram to begin with.,1,2023-07-07 00:16:15
Google Play,This is just a simplified Facebook. Nothing else. No chronological order sorting and no way to filter only those who you follow. I'll just stick to Twitter until y'all decide to give users what you want.,1,2023-07-11 18:17:48
Google Play,I was super excited to try Threads but i was super disappointed with it. My feed was just full of suggested post of people & things that didn't interest me & that i didn't follow. Hard to find the people i did follow. plus i can't search topic's. I'VE NOW DELETE APP. 😥,2,2023-07-08 08:20:22
Google Play,Had to uninstall this app as my phone started acting up after installing and using the app for two days. My phone kept on ghost tapping and scrolling or other apps would hang.,1,2023-07-08 08:46:17
Google Play,What the point of trying to be a replacement for twitter when the app doesn't allow you to only view posts from ppl you follow on your feed and doesn't allow any nsfw content. This is just an even more sanitized and advertiser friendly version of Instagram...,1,2023-07-07 16:18:51
Google Play,"This is one of the worst apps in the list of worst apps I ever used, I don't wished to be here just got here cause a friend asked me to and now I can't delete my account neither can I use this app and it is collecting some useless data that a chatting and connecting app doesn't require, I do wish it gets banned in India",1,2023-07-11 04:45:19
Google Play,Worst experience I was curious about the app but the moment I downloaded it I just regreted so bad the display was getting a glitch I don't know how it's hard to explain what was happening it was kind of crashing I never felt the app normal when I open the app it shows a glitch kind of a pattern of Matrix like appearence and it's so bad,1,2023-07-08 12:25:03

Google Play,"I just noticed that sorting the ""earliest and latest"" following has been enabled but still doesn't make it easier to fish out who follows back or not. The following should be seen from the page instead of the user's profile to verify. Another thing is the app keeps glitching when you try to see who's following back and following back doesn't seem easy afterwards.",3,2023-07-25 09:32:20
Google Play,Okay i just used to it it's okay apps don't be fool by the ppl some ppl looking for hookup and some ppl put you down (like make fun) of you stay strong 💪 stay away from ppl who have no picture in profile and Stay safe.,3,2023-07-25 08:22:07
Google Play,"MY POSTS KEEPS FAILING TO UPDATE! My posts and comments fails to post always... I can't post anything currently. Aside that, we need DIRECT MESSAGING Tab, and TRENDLIST .... Quite a nice one",2,2023-07-25 07:46:47
Google Play,"This app isn't gonna last if they don't make some major changes (like adding a following feed, literally the only way I would actually use the app regularly).",1,2023-07-25 01:30:40
Google Play,The app does NOT work on androids. I reported a billion times and they have done NOTHING to solve thr issues. So I cannot use the app. So twitter it is,1,2023-07-25 02:32:35

Google Play,It is getting good,5,2023-07-25 08:14:03
Google Play,💙,4,2023-07-25 07:15:46
Google Play,Update: Finally the issue have been resolved. It is running smoothly. Firstly from Day 1 the app is glitchy with overlapped posts and dragged screens. I haven't seen the actual interface till now. Secondly now it says that my instagram account will be deleted if I delete Threads. That's totally unfair. On one hand I can't use Threads and on the other hand I can't delete it. So I am left with last option of uninstalling it. I was so excited at first but now I am totally disappointed.,4,2023-07-24 18:11:14
Google Play,"A clearly well built app on a technical level, but god is it just so lame. Its like twitter (obv) except people only tweet Instagram captions with no picture. The lack of a trending tab, while making the app less doomery, also makes threads feel less interconnected and social.",2,2023-07-24 18:25:37
Google Play,"Not that I use it much anyway, but it basically doesn't work. It seems I can make a post, and I can view the main feed - but search, my page and the likes tab all just give an error message ('something went wrong. Try again...'). It was fine for the first 2-3 days, and given that ever since. Not really useable when the majority of tabs don't even work.",2,2023-07-25 07:55:50
Google Play,"It needs a group chat feature to share tweets with friends. It also needs an explore/search feature to stay up to date with the latest news/trends/tweets. And finally, a feature to unlink my insta account to allow creation of anonymous accounts. Add these and it'll overtake twitter.",2,2023-07-24 20:50:47
Google Play,"There is no reason for it to be difficult to navigate and do basic things. Seems rushed and really needs more time in the developer oven. Seems like I'm flooded with secret advertisment everyone is selling something or trying to get you subscribed to them, it's quite hostile",1,2023-07-24 14:18:30
Google Play,"Very much good 👍 Then compare to Twitter every one can use this without any limitations 🙏🏻 but having more features like background pic before DP on profile & thus making/showing the category such as artist, actor, visual art, so on. One thing having story option on both insta.or threads",5,2023-07-24 17:49:15
Google Play,I just tried it and this is my opinion. I would give it a zero if it was there cuz its just a worse copy of twitter. And what si that layout like I'm not a left handed. Meta just has taken twitter and made everything diffrent on their style and suddenly made it worse. Switch to twitter it is way simpler and better!,1,2023-07-24 22:33:58
Google Play,Excellent app for communication interface. Truly I'm addicted for this app. Instead of twitter I'll use this. Thank me META for providing such useful application.,5,2023-07-24 15:06:48
Google Play,Just launched app.. surely has glitches.. but as soon i log in ..the entire interface goes haywire & overlaps each other making it a matrix of lines full of distortion.,1,2023-07-25 09:13:34
Google Play,"It's got a lot of potential but for a week I haven't been able to follow anyone. If they think I'm a bot, they should make sure. It's just not fun anymore if I can't follow the people I want.",2,2023-07-25 02:40:08

Google Play,По суті це альтернатива твітеру. І зі своєю задачею типу писати пости і робити треди воно справляється.

І хотілося щоб ця соц мережа була трішечки яскравіша :3. Надіюся з часом додадуть нові цікаві функції і ті про які я вже сказала.,4,2023-07-07 08:35:11

App Store,"Hello, I am DPM DJ. I’d like to write a somewhat serious review on this app, so buckle in. First thing I notice when I go into the app is, “Hey. This looks a lot like Twitter. But…better?” Yes, it turns out that I have been enjoying this app more than Twitter and even Instagram to a certain extent due to the less toxic environment. Honestly, well done with that. This is the first time I’ve felt reasonably comfortable using a social media app. Second thing I notice…the absolute mess in my feed. Yes, I know that the app is fairly new, but my feed is looking kind of atrocious. Every time I refreshed my feed, hoping to see stuff from people I followed (which was probably around, if not over, 100 people) but was instead met with a crap ton of random people who had absolutely no affiliation with me or any of the people that I followed. That was kind of weird, but I decided not to mind that. Lastly, I decided to embrace the app’s less toxic environment, going around threads and seeing actual positive people and comments on each one. Long story short, this app is kind of like Twitter’s second chance or something, but made by a completely different social media company. Respect.",4,2023-07-07 15:58:59
App Store,"this app has an amazing feel , i really enjoy the layout it has , just generally how things are set up . but , there are many things i think should be added to updates further down the road . first off , theres no trending page . one of the things that was very useful to most people on twitter was the trending page , which is now replaced with a ""who to follow"" section , which shows up on your timeline as well . also , no dms !!! i get that its an instagram app , but i hate having to go back and forth between apps just to message someone . another issue i have is how you cannot set up and an account without having instagram , and how you cannot delete your threads account without deleting your instagram account . like i said , i understand that its connected , but itd feel a little more freeing , i guess , having the accounts be separate , or at LEAST being able to change your name/username without going into the instagram app . ALSOO , i hate how your timeline isnt , or is at least very hard to get , tailored to you . ive followed many , many people , and still get random people or celebrities ive never heard of popping up on my feed , with jokes or sayings i have no interest in . maybe its because the app is new , but i feel like a lot of other apps have adapted a lot quicker . despite these downsides though , i think the app is great . for what it has already , i havent noticed any actual issues with using it . no bugs or anything .",3,2023-07-09 05:35:44
App Store,"I’ve been hoping for something to replace Twitter and Facebook for awhile now (since Twitter was ruined and Facebook has been less and less personal for years) — so naturally Threads intrigued me. So far I’m cautiously optimistic, but it does bother me that it’s owned by Facebook/Instagram and the app is very minimal at the start. So we’ll see how it goes.

My wife and I both downloaded Threads within 24 hours of each other. I’ve had a positive experience with it so far, but for some reason her account showed her some very questionable stuff (three posts in around thirty seconds of scrolling). I’m guessing this is because I follow more accounts so I don’t see posts from unfollowed accounts, but it could also be due to Instagram privacy/security settings since many of those sync over.

My main concern at this point is with content visibility control. When someone I follow replies to someone I don’t, I should see a button to show the original post and not the full post by default. There should not be random posts on the feed, especially when they highlight risqué photos. Some people may like seeing unrelated posts, but there needs to be a simple control for seeing this or not. As it stands, my wife has deactivated her account already (less than ten minutes of use) and I may be following suit rather shortly. I understand it’s very new still, but this is important and needs to be addressed promptly for the sake of users and the platform.",2,2023-07-07 21:59:25
App Store,"Its like Twitter... only its called Threads. The immediate vibe that I got was that its intended to be a place for millennials to feel that sense of being cool again, like they once did when they got Facebook for the first time. The other problem is that I dont see what void its trying to fill, or what problem its trying to solve, other than being another Twitter ""killer"" that is going to solve all the perceived non existent problems of Twitter (Remember when everyone was all excited over the Facebook Killers known as either Google Plus or Diaspora?). I also don't really see how it heightens or enhances instagram, either. Instagram is for all intents, well laid out despite the fact that you cant have a chronological feed that shows you everyone you follow (which it would be nice to scroll through my followers, and not my top interactions + whatever else instagram's algorithm tosses up). Btw, thanks for not allowing me to delete Threads unless I delete my Insta, there is simply no reason for that much tie-in. Regardless now I have a silly @ like symbol on my profile that redirects to a defunct threads link, so good job for useless features. Lastly, in regards to people complaining about toxicity on Twitter as a reason for this app to exist, I would suggest that Twitter is neither toxic or pure, but that most have no clue how go actually use it, as all algorithms are a result of what you, the user, put into it.",1,2023-07-18 22:31:24
App Store,"If i could give it 0 stars I would. There are so many issues with this app. First of all, I couldn’t be logged into instagram and threads at the same time without getting automatically logged out of the other. The app in itself is poorly made, they made it so simple that it ended up not being user friendly. Forcing you to connect it to an instagram, keeping the same username,(some people enjoy privacy!), and impersonal timelines that are filled with unfunny verified accounts that are impossible to get rid of no matter how many you mute. You can’t even follow enough accounts you like to keep the stuff you don’t like off your timeline. Tried deactivating my threads account, not only will it not fully deactivate but you can’t remove the badge on your instagram no matter what you do, even though it tells you that you can. It just pops back up every time you restart the app or change tabs. I feel like i’m being forced to participate in something I no longer want to be a part of. This is such a terrible app I can barely put it into words. And to think that verified accounts had it before me and it still has all these issues is shocking. Very disappointing. Basically, if you like twitter, avoid this app. If you don’t like twitter, avoid this app. Even my LovenseRemote app is made better than threads.",1,2023-07-08 06:05:30
App Store,"Downloaded yesterday and I’m enjoying it for what it is so far; sign-up was super easy since you can import all your data from Instagram, and I love how you can directly access other accounts’ Insta pages to follow them there too.

My only issue is that the app feels a little bare-bones as of now. I understand it’s brand new and will be in the process of developing itself over time, but I’d love to see a bit more in terms of interface. The app feels a bit empty without a proper tagging system and it’s extremely hard for me to find new content and users to follow because my feed is mostly people I already follow on Instagram (plus random verified accounts and one or two new creators I find interest in). Please consider implementing a hashtag or keyword function for the Search bar (or maybe even an Explore page), and I’d probably find a lot more interest in the app!

Overall, this is a pretty decent start and I’m interested to see where it goes next… and to have a place to post my 3 AM intrusive thoughts.",4,2023-07-07 14:36:02
App Store,"I expect the posts on my feed to be from only the pages that I follow but what I get in addition to those posts is posts from pages that I don't even follow at all & have zero interest in following on Threads.  So Meta/Instagram/Facebook could fix that please.

The other thing is since I have two different Instagram & Thread accounts (one is my personal & the other is my artsy one that I use for arts & crafts, beauty, quotes, entertainment, & other fun, innocent stuff), I need a way similar to Twitter's way of switching accounts that makes it easier to switch accounts.

Other changes need to be made as well but these two are the ones I want the most.  I am not asking for perfection & the most perfect app since perfection is an overrated illusion, but I also understand that this is a new app & so there might be things to improve so I'm sure constructive feedback from users would be appreciated.",4,2023-07-10 20:17:51
App Store,"I will preface this by saying that I very rarely access social media; I use Snapchat for a handful of people and have a Facebook account for Marketplace. I am also NOT an Elon fanboy. The app is made very well, as Meta has quite a robust budget and talented programming team. Aside from that, I don’t like how the people you follow are shuffled between random check marks and that it’s unfiltered. Good for a basic, feed-central social media. With all that being said, this app will cause nothing but trouble. Elon Musk’s primary reason for purchasing Twitter in the first place was to divorce it from political power and fumigate the existing echo chamber. Less shadow-banning led to a more balanced ecosystem of opinions. Mark Zuckerberg, head of Meta which was known to sell user information and bolster an all around terrible support ticket system, is making a new “Twitter” right before an election cycle. I can’t wait to see how one-sided things shall be on Threads and not Twitter. I do not wish to continue using either app, however I feel as if a neutral opinion was warranted.",3,2023-07-07 17:28:15
App Store,"I enjoyed the onboarding experience of bringing in my Instagram followers. But then I was faced with an identity crisis. I’m a suburban mom on Instagram and an industry leader on Twitter. I don’t mix the two and it felt awkward. I trimmed some followers and found several Twitter friends.

I am irritated by the forced content from people I’m not following because it feels like I’m standing in the tabloid section of a grocery store. Facebook started doing this a few months ago and it drives me crazy. It is a constant stream of ads for brands and influencers I have no loyalty to. I understand that it makes the app more addictive and makes you feel like you have to constantly check it to stay up on the latest trends, but I quite Twitter because of this. I’m tired of hitting Mute and Block on Threads just to enjoy my feed of the latest trends in my industry. Let me curate my content and be intentional about what I consume. I really don’t want to know what Hollywood celebrities are doing. If this “feature” continues, this will be the reason I don’t use Threads.",3,2023-07-07 05:40:39
App Store,"I'm rooting for a Twitter replacement but threads it not it so far. The extreme connection to Instagram is really annoying. I want them to be separate, I don't want every change I make to have to reflect on both apps. I want separate usernames and pfps and I want it to not open Instagram every single time I want to change the smallest setting. 
It also desperately needs a ""people you follow"" timeline. It took only a few days for my ENTIRE feed to be absolutely zero people I follow and exclusively celebrities, brands, and influencers so until they implement a timeline change, the app is completely pointless and not really usable unless I want to spend several hours being nonstop advertised to. This could possibly work and take a lot of traffic away from Twitter as it descends into a bigoted trash heap but it needs an insane amount of work. Less hardcore connection to Instagram and better feeds. Otherwise it's just going to flounder for a while and eventually die as we all move back to Twitter or tumblr.",3,2023-07-08 14:39:27
App Store,"Threads is already a hugely better app than the dumpster fire that Twitter has become under the South African Blood Diamond heiress, space penis builder, and exploding car maker. It seems to operate smoothly, but there’s still a feeling of difficulty on how to post and repost like it is at instagram. I’m not sure if the hashtags are going to be as awkward either, as in more geared towards marketing than trending topics. This would all be easier to navigate if the app wasn’t showing up so small — basically smart phone size — on my tablet. I mean, I can just switch to my phone,  but yeah it bugs me when the size won’t integrate smoothly to the size of the screen. Otherwise, it’s a good app, and will likely replace Twitter in my social media time. Hopefully the size of the app to screen ratio is figured out quickly. I’m happy they provided a functioning app that’s not forever in beta.",4,2023-07-15 04:09:03
App Store,"so far, i am enjoying this app. obviously there are some features missing that i want, but it is good so far for it’s first update.

my one complaint about the current features though…the words i have hidden are still showing up on my timeline. this must be a bug, but it is a frustrating one, because there are certain posts i absolutely do not want to see and yet i’m still seeing them. i hope this can be fixed soon!!

otherwise, the algorithm seems much better to twitter, although it still needs some work. i’m looking for a following tab that hopefully i can make my default timeline, so i’m not seeing so many random accounts. i would also like a feature where you can switch between accounts easily, like on instagram, and i want their to be a close friends equivalent!",4,2023-07-07 14:45:23
App Store,"Threads, an app renowned for its unique features, has gained significant popularity and emerged as a preferred choice among users. Offering a range of advantages, Threads stands out as a superior platform. One notable aspect is its emphasis on fostering intimate and focused conversations, allowing users to create private groups and establish genuine connections. Moreover, Threads excels in content curation, providing personalized recommendations based on individual interests and preferences, resulting in a more tailored and enriching user experience. The app's intuitive design and seamless interface further contribute to a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience, setting Threads apart as an innovative social media platform. With its distinct features and user-friendly approach, Threads is redefining the landscape of microblogging and gaining recognition as a prominent contender in the realm of social media.",5,2023-07-06 18:52:26
App Store,"This app is super smooth. I love everything about it. Would be dope to be able to DM friends on here. The day that happens, Threads will most likely become my 1st app choice. There's a few bugs I hope they crank out, but overall smooth. I would prefer seeing post of people I follow vs seeing a bunch of random checkmark folks & businesses I don't even follow talk nonsense. I'm trying to see what my friends are Threading, not a verified wendys account. 

The only other issue I have is the app keeps force quitting when I try to thread. I try to log out and even reset the app. I've updated the app & updated my iPhone, yet it keeps booting me out the app every single time I try to post a thread. Its super annoying. Makes me not want to open the app and thread when I inspiration to post something. Kills the motivation.",4,2023-07-08 13:02:06
App Store,"I managed to make a few posts, comments, and shares before it started to crash. I can view feeds and profiles and I can like posts but when I go to comment or create a post it crashes- app closes out. I have logged out and logged back in ( which worked once) and I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times. There isn't anything wrong with my internet connection, I have plenty of space, no additional apps running in the background and both my iPhone and the app itself are at their current updated version. I have tagged them in issues on Instagram stories, I have messaged directly and then managed to send a ticket through the app all with no response. I understand if this was a user-wide issue due to the app being new but it is not. I would have better to say because I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the beginning but can no longer enjoy because I can no longer engage. A fix is needed.",2,2023-07-08 18:22:12
App Store,"this is literally the better twitter. the community is less toxic and the app as a whole is just better. there’s way less ads which is also a plus. HOWEVER one of the main problems is in your main feed, there tends to be a bunch of random threads from people you don’t even follow or associate with who you follow. i do understand that this is a new app though and the algorithm is a work in progress which is understandable. one thing i think would make the app a little cooler, and even better than twitter, is if you had app theming, kinda like how you can theme the direct messages on instagram, but instead have it on threads, and have it be the whole app. (it would be really cool to open up a pink threads app 🤭) overall i think the app is really cool, good job 👍",5,2023-07-18 10:14:16
App Store,"The poor performance of the service was the worst part of it overall. Takes way too long for anything to load including just text which is crazy to me given Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and really any other service is generally quick even with content that is media rich. The other problem is the feed is boring. I see plenty of things that are utterly uninteresting to me despite the likely importing of my interests and data from instagram. I would have expected that that would having me seeing things that were at least semi relevant to me but that is not the case. The thing I like about twitter is the ability to curate what I want to see but the approach here seems to be that the user is not in control of what they see or don’t see. All that said if this all was improved I could see myself liking Threads but for now it’s not that great",2,2023-07-10 16:52:07
App Store,"App that was definitely just dropped because people were fussing about twitter again and don’t get me wrong because I’d love to see new competition so twitter will step up and stop making dumb decisions, but as of now, why would I have any reason to use threads? Profiles are boring and messy, no customization besides changing your icon and putting a link, no pinned posts or some sort of media tab, no way to browse people you ACTUALLY follow, and what was the point of flexing no ads if the following feed is brand after brand after brand anyways?   There’s also no dms. 
Uninstalled after muting over a hundreds accounts, random celebrities and tiktok stars and brands I’ve never even heard of just keep appearing. Not worth your time, just keep using instagram because really, what’s the point of this app with how empty it is? Maybe in the future they will add dms and options to pin posts or have a media tab, but I legitimately can’t believe people were hyping up what’s half of a finished app",1,2023-07-10 18:11:49
App Store,"Please don’t fumble this app. I’m not trying to see a bunch of random people w/ check marks on my timeline. Let me choose who and what I want to see. I don’t want to see ads and bots everywhere like on Facebook & Instagram 🙄. I’d like to see more UI changes, everything seems small. Not compressed but the font & profile pics, names and three dots to mute/block/report is kinda on the small side and very easy to misclick. Is there an algorithm? Will there be “based on what you like”? Will we be able to switch accounts like on Instagram just by double tapping the profile tab? Will we get a following tab, so we don’t have to weed through random threads? Will we be able to have muted & blocked accounts carry over to our Thread account? If I mute someone why am I still able to see their replies in others threads?",4,2023-07-06 07:13:43
App Store,"A real sense of community without spam, nudity, and general content you do not wish to see. There may be a sacrifice of my anonymous data being sold to corps, but I am getting exactly what I want so I don’t care. Peace and tranquility and a sense of community is what I was attempting to find on other apps, and this is the first one. It’s a conversation! It’s not an argument. It’s not spoon feeding me videos all day as I scroll past over and over again. This is a new way for me to interact with people of my interests without being bombarded with outside influences. 

Nevertheless, there is still a great mixture of conversations you can randomly begin to be a part of that may not be of interest.

App Store,"Got fed up with Twitter and decided to use Threads. I already have an account on insta so the sign-up process was smooth which is appreciated. If you’re familiar with how Twitter functions, Threads is similar and will be easy to pick up. 

Some stuff I’ve noticed that I hope will be added soon: “search engine” is nonexistent, hashtags don’t work (cuz there’s no “search engine” I’m gonna assume), and if you wanna plan out future posts you can’t. Idk if it’s due to this being an early version of the app and it not being completely finished + not wanting to be super similar to Instagram + wanting to differentiate itself from Instagram since all those features are available on that app but it would be nice to include them in Threads. Pls add these functions to Threads! Thanks in advance",4,2023-07-12 23:12:45
App Store,"Twitter is better, and this app is horrible. Threads deserves 1 star because it’s boring and not the same as Twitter. Also I don’t think we really needed a twitter clone. Tbh I think we have enough social media as it is LOL. Also why leave or delete twitter when you literally have the biggest following on twitter. Also, for all the people that are trying to leave Twitter because you're too soft to deal with people, grow up LOL. Every social media app has bots and annoying people. It’s literally the internet; if you don’t like it, get off. Threads literally has the same thing as Twitter that’s why threads are implementing rate limits on the app now. Also, If you are leaving Twitter because of Elon Musk, well... I would rather trust Musk than the person who can’t keep data safe and also has privacy issues on their app. At least Musk hasn’t been to court for mishandling millions of people's data. A lot of people forget about what Zuckerberg has done with our data.",1,2023-07-23 07:56:41
App Store,"The app is obviously in its early stages, with missing features like dms and a trending page. Still, I think the app runs very smooth, looks nice, and has great potential. I’ve already seen an increase of activity as the days go by, and I’m excited to see the app grow!

To everyone who is leaving 1 star reviews, realize that this app came out less than a week ago. You have no sense of how apps work if you think they would have all functions available at once. Of course it’s not perfect, and you shouldn't expect that from ANY new app. Especially considering a new social media platform is impossibly difficult to start up. But we know it’s more than just another app review for some of you out there.",5,2023-07-07 04:27:47

I tried to contest the ban but then the app completely froze for multiple minutes. I restarted the app and now it just says there's been an error. I even deleted and redownloaded the app and it still has the same message that I cant escape. there's literally nothing I can do. I'm just glad I made the account with a new instagram and not my personal account because if my actual instagram got banned for no reason I would be even more mad. On top of this, the app itself is like they combined all the worst parts of twitter and instagram, and left out anything good. The feed is clogged with posts accounts from accounts you don't follow, there's no post notification tab, no translate button, you can't select text, you can't search for specific posts, interface is cluttered, I could go on.",1,2023-07-06 14:06:52
App Store,"Briefly speaking, this app is decent overall, just needs some more updates like editing and better thread navigation stuff to be a more viable competitor to Twitter/be “Meta/Facebook/Instagram” Twitter.

Now for the data tracking rant.

To be fair, everything ends up collecting our data in some way or form and share it with everything else on the internet at some point. Though this is Meta which is one of the few social media apps that are notoriously bad for tracking data, they do not even bother trying to hide it for this app. At least with Facebook and Instagram you at least have the option to opt out (more likely give you the comfort feeling, not necessarily completely opting out) of tracking both as a pop up and in the settings (for ads mainly). This app? It tracks basically everything, and doesn’t even prompt you at all.",2,2023-07-15 00:49:16

I go to their page but don’t see any of their threads or replies. It says “Content not available”. When I try to reply to a thread it shows up as a reply but it says “your thread failed to upload”. If I click the heart at the bottom I go to the Activity page. On that page no matter what I select from the menu: All, Follows, Replies, etc… each says “Sorry,something went wrong. Try again”. My wireless connection is strong. I’ve tried both with and without a VPN. I’ve deleted and re-downloaded the app a few times. Nothing helps. Always the same result with the same bugs.",4,2023-07-22 04:39:01
App Store,"so far, i like threads. it’s pretty solid for now, it can be better. that being said, i do have some suggestions for the app developers to improve the app for users: 

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!
only the ppl i follow and their activity should be in my timeline, not these other random users…put them on a separate page
the separate page should be our home page with news, pop culture events, hashtags you follow, and the random users/suggested posts here
pls give us hashtags!
search by hashtags and words, not just users 
thumbs down for threads (dislike count not shown public)
pls give us a gif library in the threads post area
a drafts/save for later tab for threads
following count put by the follower count too. why is it just one? show both or neither, pls pick one
show list of likes + the option to keep it private
saved/bookmarks tab (private)
dms/private messages on here 
voice message for threads
close friends thread list
these changes would make a lot of people (including me) use the app a whole lot more and come back to give a higher review rating. we thank you for the hard work so far. and thx for listening!🩷",4,2023-07-06 15:40:06
App Store,"Zuck, my boy…if we’re gonna rake in the legal trouble by “mimicking” or grabbing “inspiration” from the bird next door *wink wink* let’s go ahead and stick to what works. Please, I beg you, fix the video playback on this app. Let’s grant users the option to disable auto-play, let’s add a scrolling tool so we don’t have to sit through the whole video or (God forbid) have our fingers slip and start the video all the way from the beginning, and let’s fix that pesky/stubborn audio enable button. 

Also, let’s update the U.I. a little bit. It’s giving: bland. Let’s add some pizzazz! I enjoy seeing what threads my friends reply to, but I also wanna see what they like. 

Lastly, the search tab…have your team take some notes on what Bluey’s doing to make things interactive (i.e. “For you”, “Trending”, “News”, etc.) and move forward from there. Thanks buddy.",3,2023-07-08 07:38:58
App Store,"Like many people have said, I’ve been wanting something to replace twitter for a while and so far this is doing a good job at being that platform. I don’t like, however, that my feed is flooded with meme accounts already, and I don’t see what my friends are posting. I’m sure my friends are not posting much, with it being such a new app, but the millions of memes in my homepage ensures I will never see them. It would be nice to have the home feed dedicated to just who you’re following, even if there’s nothing new for a while, and have the search page be for meme accounts and such. Or maybe a “posts you may like” page or something. If I wanted to see a bunch of garbage on my feed I would go to Facebook. I guess I’m just hoping for something more personal and focused on people I actually know.",3,2023-07-13 08:33:21
App Store,"I recently tried out this app, and let me tell you, it was a total letdown. Right from the start, the user interface was a mess. I mean, seriously, what were they thinking? It was confusing and just plain ugly. It felt like they randomly threw everything together without any thought for user experience. I was left scratching my head, trying to figure out where everything was.

But that's not all. The app had serious performance issues. It was as slow as a snail on a Sunday stroll. Every tap felt like an eternity, and don't even get me started on the freezing! I'd be in the middle of doing something, and bam! The app would freeze, leaving me frustrated and annoyed.

And here's the real kicker: Threads had this crazy, over-the-top censorship going on. They didn't want anyone to say anything remotely controversial or express any dissenting opinions. Come on! We should be able to have open conversations without being muzzled. It felt like they were trying to control what we could and couldn't say, and that's just plain wrong.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend Threads to anyone. The terrible user interface, performance issues, and heavy-handed censorship make it a complete waste of time. If you're looking for an app that values free speech and actually works well, keep on searching, my friend. Threads is definitely not the one for you.",1,2023-07-10 14:08:57
App Store,"so yea, the app was amazing cuz its exactly the same like Twitter and its obviously benefit us cuz we don’t have to create another account for this apps cuz we can just use Instagram, just the serious major problems that everyone may faced the same things as me, the apps seriously take up too much space, like compare to Twitter the, the megabytes is too small and the programmed works really well-the lossless compression really work for twitter, and another things that i would want to pointed out is that since the storage is limit for certain peoples and deleting the apps seriously devastating them cuz their account is getting deleted at the same time, its really devastating and upsetting me, i wish that by deleting the apps don’t cause their instagram account getting deleted, but overall im really enjoying the thread apps",3,2023-07-11 16:06:57
App Store,"The app in itself is ok. However, there needs to be a separate page for posts ONLY from people that I follow show up, none of that stupid algorithm recommending me some random accounts. There should be a sort of “explore” page for the algorithm to be implemented and suggest any content including from accounts I don’t follow and another page only for posts from those I follow. There should also be a mechanism to get rid of bots and spam accounts easily and quickly as I have already seen many bots under several posts. This is an issue that Twitter suffers pretty badly from and it looks like threads is going to as well.

Allow gif replies too. Also should allow replies to be hidden from followers👍🏻",4,2023-07-10 15:34:48
App Store,"No point in getting this app if you want to use it to keep in touch with mutuals. You will not see who you follow on your feed, even if you change the settings to see so you follow first. You only get to see for posts at most by who you follow, after that, you just get recommended accounts who are verified and only post twitter screenshots. I hate twitter so only seeing twitters negativity is really disappointing. 

Even if you’re content just seeing certain mutuals, if you accidentally refresh the app, you’ll never find whatever posts you were looking at, posted by your following, ever again. Your best bet to see all of who you follow Is to individually check all of their profiles daily. Who has time for that though? Might as well just take following people on the app off. Really disappointing for small creators. Not even upset for myself, just want to support my friends. Genuinely impossible. 

Another thing, pictures upload in  bad quality just line Instagram. 5 second videos take 5 minutes to upload. You have to click on the video and full screen it if you want to listen to it, with Instagram, don’t even have to click the video. You just turn up your volume and that’s why I love instagrams. 

Praying they fix that following feed issue or it’ll be the apps biggest downfall tbh.",1,2023-07-09 23:37:14

Actually maybe it can be called THREADED I kinda like the sound of that honestly. Tho even if you didn’t add these things the app is already really good, I’m pretty you guys won’t F this up.

There are ads everywhere, there’s content I just do not care to see which causes me to miss the content of the people I actually follow. Also never Get rid of the free form writing features; tab or return button allowing us to create space between paragraphs, as well as the capability to write longer paragraphs. Simple and clean is the way to go in my opinion, I love to write and I love to read.

2. GIPHY keyboard from iPhone does not work like it would on competitor apps

Head of Instagram acknowledged that unintentional restrictions would be put on active users with good intentions with no way of getting ahold of the company. You see so much crap, and you have no control of your feed. When you unfollow people you will see the egregious content anyway.

I like how I’m able to connect with my Instagram followers through Threads, but you aren’t able to see who is mutually following you, or who follows you back. The overall layout of the time line is quite minimalistic, and reminds me of Tumblr in a way, so I eased into the format. I also wish we could change our usernames and names?

Elon musk lovers are mad, but they really should just be worried since this will definitely kill twitter. The UI is slick and the features work so far.

They want to keep a positive vibe and they feel that those topics are too heated. Sure this makes it a more pleasant place but I do not believe people should be sheltered from the harsh realities of our world just to avoid arguments. 

There needs to be a dark mode. I have photosensitivity and looking and a bright white screen hurts my eyes.

• Chat (text posts)
• Gallery (Videos and photos)
• Social (Replies, quotes, reposts).

—

      Then you can also add search filters to find posts that fall under one of those three tabs, instead of just searching accounts. This way you can’t neatly organize the blog aspect, the social aspect, and the artistic aspect! In my opinion this would make it MUCH more user friendly. That way when I want to look at my favorite artists work, I don’t have to scroll through hours of ended conversions or reposts. If I’m looking for a topic to talk about, I don’t have to scroll through pictures to do it. It would also mean I could quote and repost other people’s stuff more without worrying about burying my own work/making my page impossible to navigate.

The app's performance has hit an all-time low. It lags, freezes, and crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to have a smooth browsing experience. It's as if the developers took a promising app and intentionally wrecked it.

And don't even get me started on the algorithm! The prioritization of irrelevant and repetitive content is mind-numbing. I followed accounts for a reason, but they are rarely shown, while suggestions that I have no interest in flood my feed. It's an infuriating waste of time.

The app also bombards users with endless ads and sponsored content, effectively killing the authenticity and charm of the platform. This invasive approach feels greedy and reflects a lack of respect for users' time and attention.

In conclusion, the app has become a breeding ground for frustration. Its glitches, algorithmic failures, lack of action against harassment, excessive ads, and poor UX have turned a once-promising platform into a colossal disappointment.

Thirdly, a trending page/trending hashtags would be great. Since you’re clearly taking a page out of Twitter’s playbook, why not add the good parts of Twitter?

It doesn’t shadow ban, but it also doesn’t shows you threads of people you don’t even follow nor are interested in, which is what it does now.  Someone like a Jennifer Aniston merely posts a hand wave and 400,000 people click like.  (Rolling eyes here).  How about you create an app that actually shows really great content.

They’re also not automatically following me for the same reason. They have to manually find me.

Personally, I don’t see a point to use it when I already have Twitter and Instagram. I can see how it can appeal to some people, because you get more of the fake celebrities on here than you do on Twitter, which are usually the most popular, but to each their own. I’ll be deleting the app, since I hear that if I close the account, I also lose my Instagram account, which I’ve had for years. What a terrible decision to link both apps that way.",1,2023-07-21 03:56:32
App Store,"Dropping another star because my news feed is 95% influencers and crap I don’t follow on ANY platform, but for some reason you guys pushed the app out before you could get your algorithms decent. Spent the last 15 minutes muting every other account because  ya’ll can’t just give us what we want. Please make the first update to have our feed people we follow ONLY. 

Dropping a star because my Thread's feed is ALREADY filled celebrities, influencers and other pages I have no interest in and don’t follow. Please, PLEASE keep the feed to who we follow in chronological order. 

So far I like it, but I’d like to be able to hide accounts I don’t want in my feed other than by blocking or restricting. They didn’t do anything wrong, I just don’t care about them.",2,2023-07-08 13:59:03
App Store,"I know there are tons of updates coming but Twitter will show the ANNOYING “refresh feed” icon under the front camera, which when pressed sends you to the VERY TOP of your feed. Threads has the same. thing. 

Twitter at least allows you to close the app from your Home Screen, re open Twitter, and the icon is gone BUT you remain at the same place where you were previously scrolling. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE allow users to do this on BOTH Instagram and Threads. I see a post I’m about to repost, like, or reply to, and then my feed refreshes where I lose the post forever. It makes me not want to use the Threads app!!",4,2023-07-07 18:14:32
App Store,"The app is decent a lot of the time so far but for it to be great i think it should distance itself a little bit from instagram, still have the option to link it with insta but not rely on it entirely. 
I really think there needs to be more user experience to it like asap, dm’s seeing your own likes, allowing people to follow without needing to accept a request when you have a public profile, SAVING POSTS‼️‼️etc I really want all these things to be added/fixed like yesterday haha- oh also make it easier for people who follow a lot of people at once to not be assumed as a spam bot please :) cant log into my account anymore bc of that",3,2023-07-09 00:28:54
App Store,"I downloaded the app a few minutes after its public launch and have used it every day since then. I understand that there are a lot of features that still need to be added. I love the interactions on the app and knowing that the content is moderated for hate speech and other hateful things is deeply reassuring. 
I find the general atmosphere of the app to be uplifting, informative, and positive and I hope it stays this way!!
Thank you Meta, despite my reservations about you, for giving us this new virtual space to build real communities!!",5,2023-07-16 14:55:12
App Store,"Great solution to twitter, fun to scroll through people’s thoughts and news but it’s a new app and you can tell it’s missing features. I think with time it’ll be a fantastic app if it stays afloat. One thing I’d like to suggest is separate tabs to view threads from just people your following and a tab for explore/discovery/for you, also and edit feature would be useful instead of deleting posts if you misspell and one more quality of life feature would be double tapping posts to like it would tie it into instagram nicely. Overall I think it’s a great app and look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future🪡",4,2023-07-06 21:26:56
App Store,"The app is nice. I like the replacement twitter. Its good for old twitter users and for those who never have to ever experience that app and its users which is amazing in so many more ways than one. I wonder why this feature was not added onto Instagram instead than a separate app though? Many of Instagram’s users will probably be hearing this app around and have probably been asking for the text post feature for a while now, such as a myself. I hope to see this app do well and maybe even as an addition to Instagram than its own separate thing. I would do anything for text posts on Instagram.",4,2023-07-06 06:01:52
App Store,"Right now all I can rate this app is 3 stars. It’s generally pretty good, the layout is great and it feels much less toxic than what it’s trying to replace which is always a plus. Unfortunately, there’s some issues that I can’t get past without docking points. There’s no direct messaging feature, that coupled with the need of an instagram account to use the app means that this is not a standalone app but more of an addition to Instagram. Also, the algorithm isn’t the best. It’s difficult to curate your feed to stuff you want to see, like specific topics, which is something some users are already leaving over. All in all, still better than Twitter.",3,2023-07-18 11:35:45
App Store,"I made a parody account on Thread and within a couple hours it was suspended even though it clearly (in bio and user name) was not the person it was parody of.  Their “appeals” process only allowed for me to confirm a password and phone number. You cannot actually appeal, or fix whatever they determined was a violation in the first place. One I submitted my “appeal” (only phone number and password) within seconds they somehow were able to determine the ban was worthy of being permanent. Another gem of an app from the Zuckerberg farm. Further they’ll appeal all your accounts associated w your phone number (across meta/Facebook, Instagram, etc too) even if those did not violate any rules. Do not trust them with your data and use at your own risk!",1,2023-07-09 05:35:54

There have been many threads i have wanted to draft just to keep them for myself but can’t because the app simply doesn’t have that feature as of now, but i hope that as the app develops and updates more that we will have it in the future along with many other things",4,2023-07-16 11:10:20
App Store,"At first glance this app seems like an amazing mobile application. I’ve always enjoyed Instagram and I’ve always enjoyed Twitter. However, once you install this app, you will realize that you can never delete your threads account. Unless you delete your Instagram account also. For some reason, Zuckerberg and the Instagram meta-team think it’s a good idea to grab all of your health data, political, affiliations, religious beliefs, and even your credit score. Now on top of that, if you install this app due to all of the data mining that it is stealing behind the scenes, this app will drain your battery faster than any app that I’ve ever seen. So a reminder, this app is like hotel, California you can thread in anytime you like, but you can never leave.",1,2023-07-14 18:31:21
App Store,"Threads in its current iteration is a random collection of unsorted and unsortable conversations among people I don't know and mostly don't care to know. Why do I follow people or have followers? I cannot actually follow anyone unless I navigate (tediously) to their profile page and scroll down at threads they created or re-threaded. That is just too cumbersome to provide an enjoyable experience. For example, I welcomed a dozen or so folks that cover my favorite college teams. But, now that Threads has scale, I rarely ever see their posts, excuse me, threads. Oh, I can still find their comments - - - over on Twitter in my Sports List. Threads is like I am at a cocktail party, incognito, overhearing conversations and feeling like I just want to leave.",2,2023-07-23 21:39:11
App Store,"When I first installed it, it was fine, did what it’s supposed to. After a couple days, I couldn’t view any replies to posts, any posts of a (public) user, it was basically worthless. Keep getting “Something went wrong, try again” error or “Content not available”. Tried all solutions but none worked, so I had to delete the app. Hopefully a future release will fix this problem because I really want to use it.

I also was bothered that upon installation, many of my Instagram followers “requested” a follow (which is an automatic thing upon install?). It would be nice to differentiate who actually clicked a follow button, and who did the automatic follow request.",2,2023-07-18 07:38:06

I have real friends I follow on there and they are nowhere to be found. I deleted Twitter long ago, so I probably should’ve realized it would be the same to me. It’s just annoying seeing all the same influencers sharing their same content on every app. I miss seeing people I want to interact with. Most of them don’t even interact with us peasants…",3,2023-07-19 03:18:49
App Store,Good start but could be fleshed out a little more. I really hope they make it easy for you to switch between accounts like Instagram does so you don’t have to log out and log in every time. It’s also easy to switch apps from threads to Instagram but not visa-versa. Threads has an Instagram logo top right to switch easily but to switch from Instagram to threads there is no such shortcut. I would also like to possibly see a your all caught up divider so you don’t mindlessly scroll the threads you seen before.,5,2023-07-11 08:50:13

Only upstaged by a relentless stream of the trashiest influencers who have ever roamed this scorched earth. There’s no escaping the Kardashian wannabes breaking news regurgitaters, as they fill my feed with garbage I never asked for. Why oh why would you treat such a well designed app with such disrespect? Oh, I know. Because the name of the game is maximum attention. It’s only a matter of time before the ads are interleaved between the celebrity trash talk. Then the only step left is to optimize the algorithm to maximize fear and anxiety to increase stickiness.

The main home page is filled with nothing but posts from people I don’t even follow. I understand these big companies need to make money and paid posts are a thing as much as we hate them. But the thing that’s most annoying is that we thought this would be an app for us IRL friends to connect with one another by allowing us to choose not to follow celebrities or big companies but yet we can’t get away from them and my friends posts are nowhere to be seen. Feels like just another big tech app putting money before the users.",2,2023-07-07 16:08:34

Do you want to give access to a company that is that incompetent all your personal data? Scroll down to the description of what information this app collects about you. That’s not necessary to run a short posting service. It is necessary to run a business where they sell your data to other businesses.

App Store,"so i love the idea of threads. it’s a cool form of self expression especially since twitter became a ghost town (no one uses it anymore). but some things are already annoying me. firstly, having random verified people on my feed and i don’t care about them. i think we should have an option to see public thoughts and separate our followers. kinda like how ig has a favorite section on posting. secondly, i think it would be so cool if threads were built into the actual instagram app. similar to reels, we could also make threads a part of our profile. it could be a separate section like reels have that people can see our thoughts and get to know how we think. i think having a separate app is kinda extra. i love it but not a lot of people are actually interested in downloading another app, where as on the actual ig, like the new notes feature, people would engage more. other than that, i love this new addition!",4,2023-07-06 03:10:10

so honest review WITHOUT BIAS;

this is a fad and is going to fizzle out rather quickly, there is nothing special or unique about this app and it essentially seems to be just an extention of instagram with a much worse algorithm. The feed is not really tailored to you so much as its just whats popular. It connects fully with the meta ecosystem which causes privacy concerns for me; (id also like my accounts to be separate but connected for once). it seems like they released a beta version or something because this cant be a finished product",2,2023-07-07 16:34:23
App Store,"Threads is an interesting app with potential. It's sad how we can't add back the Threads badge to Instagram after removing it. We're also still missing basic features, such as the (1) tab to view only threads from those we follow, (2) ability to search up topics or we're interested in, and (3) privacy functions to hide those we follow and/or those that follow us. Other social media apps have these basic features! It'd be interesting to see more forum-like aspects incorporated on it. After all, forums and other discussion boards have Threads! I'm hoping topics will be organized and clearly presented (or easily found)..",3,2023-07-14 17:50:12
App Store,"Threads is the single greatest waste of time I ever came across. 98% of my feed filled with posts from users I don't even follow. People I follow aren't engaging with those posts either. Just feels like spam. I have spent more time reporting posts like this as spam, bc they're clogging up my feed. IG is already an established distraction where we are trying to keep up w our friend's businesses and shenanigans. Threads feels like a desperate outlet for incredibly bored people. Otherwise, is it just another app collecting user activity to feed a server with data?

I believe that it must have something to do with me logging in so many times with my Instagram account every time I opened the app yesterday.

Things I don’t like is seeing people I follow respond to other threads. That should be a feature one can turn off.  I just want a clean timeline of threads I follow.

Expecting this to be dealt with, I flagged to the content moderation team only to be told that this sort of thing (hard R, crypto scams) were not against the rules and would not be removed. 
If this is the policy then I’m afraid the site will quickly become just as toxic as the others. Such a shame as it has such potential. I wish them all the best but if there is no rule against hate speech, nudity or scams, it’s not something I want to be a part of.",2,2023-07-10 01:59:32

Leads me into my next point, I can't seem to comment or post threads. It's literally the main purpose of this app too. I've tried uninstalling it and redownloading it and refreshing my feed. Nothing works, it just keeps kicking me out everytime I try to post something. Could be something I'm only experiencing, and it's not that big of a deal because I don't post much anyways.

There’s no TAGS. You can look up specific users and that’s it. No way of finding other people, it’s just whatever the algorithm feeds you- which will be mostly blue checks trying to get in your good graces so you buy their crap or whatever.

They treat all artists like their UNPAID content creators and even if you are just starting out and have a small following they limit your reach of your posts don’t perform to their standards.

Pros: Signup was a snap since it directly took my information from Facebook and Instagram. 

Cons: There are obvious missing features that Twitter has:
1 There is no institutional integration with other sites to direct users to Thread feed
2 No direct messaging 
3 No way to organize Thread followings to given topics (e.g. sports Threads in a feed)
4. The feed puts topics that would not appeal to me. Why didn’t include this knowledge from FB/IG?
5. No integration with FB/IG
6. No way to remove suggested Threads from feeds. 
7. No way to taylor ads to my desires
8. Nothing new or innovative compared to Twitter, Parler, et al.
9. None of my Followers on FB/IG directly transferred to Threads.

This questionable data handling practice raises serious privacy concerns and leaves users in the dark about how their personal information is being used.

One thing that I really like is regardless of using your instagram account for threads, you can choose to have your Threads profile public while keeping your Instagram account private. Again, this is a new platform and my thoughts on this could change for the better or worse over time.",5,2023-07-06 08:43:20
App Store,"It works as it's supposed to, but there is a bug or something that's slowing down the loading of one's own replies. That might be due to the influx of users, but it's still something that's a little bit annoying.

There's also no way to search for specific words or find trending topics, which is a huge feature this app is lacking that is severely needed. Hopefully this is something that will be added in the very near future.",4,2023-07-06 03:04:33
App Store,"I'm a US resident, but I was in Europe when Threads launched. it seems to have marked me as an EU resident and it's keeping me from accessing my profile, notifications, and content Despite my Instagram account having an ad account with a US phone number and address as proof. I have three Instagram accounts (business, personal, and niche hobby) with none of the linked Thread accounts accessible. I've cleared the cache, deleted and reinstalled the app, deleted the app, restarted my phone, and then reinstalled. Nothing works. I've tried contacting IG support, but I know from past experience that they won't get back to me, so maybe a review of the app will.

Facebook to Instagram etc etc so the future is more going to be about what flavor and company you prefer not necessarily what’s “better “ I’m here for Threads all day to succeed bc I prefer instagram predominantly and my prayers have been answered for them to roll out this style of app/ social media platform, I love it, can’t wait to see how it improves.",4,2023-07-07 04:15:48
App Store,"Threads is the most “social” social media has felt in a while. There’s no fluff, just pure, unadulterated vibes! The simplicity and straightforwardness is the most exciting thing about this app. I dread the day ads and DMs are implemented, and pray that they won’t be.

I hope you fix it soon, great app",4,2023-07-14 02:25:17
App Store,"Threads is such an elegantly simple concept executed upon so well that it’s effectively replaced Twitter in my daily app rotation. 

Twitter still has some quality of life features that Threads is missing, but the dev team at Meta has been super transparent about changes and improvements they plan to implement which stands in stark contrast to Twitter randomly breaking the app every other day. 

Bottom line, if you’re tired of twitter, consider trying Threads out",5,2023-07-12 20:20:17
App Store,"Threads was fun for the first two weeks. After that it just became boring. It’s missing a lot of very basic features like drafts, bookmarking threads, ability to edit threads, and so much more. If they want it to be a “Twitter killer” they have to work a lot faster to add those things. It’s been two weeks and still nothing. Lame and boring. It only got so many people on the first day cause it is so easy to sign up for. Just use your Instagram login. Other than that, there is really nothing special about Threads. It’s just a Twitter clone but a very boring version of it.",3,2023-07-17 20:13:56
App Store,Decided to try this app out since I’ve heard others talking about it saying it’s a better Twitter. Started going through the people I follow originally on Instagram to find out that once I get off the app I’m not following them anymore. I thought it was a one time glitch until I’ve tried it four times and it stills says I need to follow. Not sure when the next bug fixes will be but it’s inconvenient. The overall look is clean I can see potential in the app. Not sure if a lot of people will use this app since there is already Twitter and to have two apps that are identical is beyond me.,2,2023-07-16 03:42:23
App Store,"Liking this app so far, many aspects of it’s current state of simplicity is enjoyable compared to many of these bloated apps today- not sure if there’s intention to keep it this way. 

One thing I don’t like so much is the feed right now. I know I don’t follow many people and they aren’t posting, but there are a lot of posts I don’t want to see, a majority of them. Maybe an interest flow or something could get this right. Not sure. But currently I don’t want to see a majority of the threads on my feed",4,2023-07-07 10:58:20
App Store,"The app isn’t too bad and so far it feels like old Twitter. There are problems though. You can’t save posts, no edit function, searching for people/pages isn’t easy, and no info about what’s trending. 

I’m basically saying that I want Twitter cause honestly I still do. I’m only trying this because if anything could replace Twitter it might be Thread. Mainly because it’s the closest comp and probably the literal point of the app. 

Also why are people rooting for this? I mean that would cause Meta to have an even more disproportionate influence on social media…",3,2023-07-07 16:52:10
App Store,"The app is OK and it has a lot of bugs. It is not as good is twitter at all. I’ve had so many problems since this app has came out not only that it is a copy of Twitter and a jp app that is 90% just like this app which I don’t find that is right I don’t like the fact that I have to have random feeds and stuff pop up all the time that I am not even interested in they need to have it where you can sign into more than one of your accounts. I have other accounts I would like to make one for but you can’t

App Store,"Thank you Meta for creating a great alternative to Twitter. I can already feel a safer, more enjoyable space - thank you!!!

Some issues: Easy to use, but no use of hashtags. You have to log out to sign into a different account. If you wish to delete your account, it will also delete your Instagram account. 

Overall though, Threads is solid. Easy to use. Reliable and overall content is better. People are happier on Threads vs Twitter. This is the app we have been asking for!!",4,2023-07-06 17:31:00
App Store,"Honestly I love the concept of this app and it seems like it's amazing for a lot of people but the problem is I cannot actually use it because every time I click the option to either post or reply, it immediately crashes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I tried shutting my phone off, and I haven't seen any available updates to fix the problem. It's a shame because I'd love to actually engage with the platform but I can't do that if it keeps crashing like this. If there's any way to fix this that I haven't tried, please let me know 🙏",2,2023-07-12 04:21:26
App Store,I like threads better than twitter because you can find your instagram friends on there and directly see everything. On twitter everyone has secret accounts and its not easy to find people in real life twitter account. I never got into twitter because of how confusing it is to find everyone and to find the right account that interests me. With threads everyone who im following on instagram is there & it makes me feel comfortable,5,2023-07-08 09:45:37
App Store,"I am extremely disappointed with the functionality of the Threads app. Despite multiple attempts, including logging out and logging back in, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have been unable to upload new posts on my phone. It is incredibly frustrating to encounter such a basic issue that prevents me from sharing my experiences and engaging with others. In today’s fast-paced world, where seamless communication is essential, it is unacceptable for an app to fail at its core function. I sincerely hope that the developers address this problem promptly and enhance the app’s reliability and performance to ensure a smoother user experience.",1,2023-07-06 10:25:43
App Store,"Came over from Twitter, where I primarily used my account for semi-professional networking.

The pros:
• quite a bit of my network has followed because Threads is well put together
• making account was easy, albeit required I make a new instagram account
• more or less functions how everyone would expect

The one giant con is that there’s no following page. I’m a young person who follows (and enjoys) some of the pop culture pages on my personal account, where I follow them. I don’t want to see them on my professional account, where I’m scrolling to see what’s new in my field. Although less of an issue, the vice versa is also true. 

This feels like an easy fix that should be top of the list - give me the option to just look at the interactions of who I signed up to follow!",4,2023-07-10 10:56:15
App Store,"I’ve been using this app for a couple days now, and it is amazing for a Twitter alternative. If there was one thing that Threads could have, is the ability to switch accounts like you can on Instagram. I made threads for all 3 of my accounts, and the way to switch accounts currently is a bit time consuming, and kinda takes away from my experience. Other than that, amazing app, amazing community!",5,2023-07-09 12:17:36
App Store,"I’m very annoyed that it limits how many people I can search for. It’s a new app, I need to search for my people that I have on other platforms. That makes sense to me. And just as others are coming coming onboard I get limited. My favorite just went live and I’m blocked because of this ambiguous rule and I’m missing out on posting on their feed. 

But don’t worry. I’m getting threads suggested feeds. Which has not been the biggest hit. Again, wouldn’t be a big deal if I could better curate my list. Right now, I’m annoyed.",3,2023-07-06 15:38:58

App Store,Definitely a lot of features missing but I’m sure they’ll be added. Such as a chronological feed and seeing only who you follow. Another one I don’t see much talk about is for videos a slider to control it(I’d like if we could slide left to right like in default apple video player). Lastly two small things are to double tap to zoom not this pinch to zoom and it doesn’t stay and when you swipe to refresh give it some haptic feedback.,4,2023-07-08 10:56:53
App Store,"After reading “Data Linked to You” I couldn’t think of a metric they’re not collecting. Someone needs to tell Meta that “1984” was a warning and not an instruction manual.

If you loved the abuse Meta foisted of you with Facebook and Instagram through the pushing of the most inflammatory content solely to raise engagement and their emotionally manipulative advertising all the while tracking you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet you’ll love Treads. Otherwise join Mastodon which doesn’t manipulate your feed, has no advertising and collects zero tracking data on its users.

Threads again shows Meta is an electronic version of cancer.",1,2023-07-09 10:47:15
App Store,"So as none of you will know I had an issue where threads would crash upon replying to a post or creating a post, well the issue was fixed, but to be honest I don't feel like it deserves 5 stars, that's because it's still an app in development and could use some upgrades, like DM's, translating posts and replies, being able to lookup gifs within the app and the list could go on and on, but overall it's a pretty good start",4,2023-07-14 12:57:42
App Store,"Threads is great. And I know there is more to come. Personally, one of my favorite things about Threads is the total absence of ads as I scroll.

Plus the community on Threads right now is such a vibe and so positive. I’m rooting for Threads to keep growing. It’s got huge potential. Let’s go!",5,2023-07-08 18:40:31

Today, I haven't seen a single post from my friends, instead the feed is entirely people I don't know and don't follow. I refreshed the page and decided to scroll and count how many stranger posts I'd see before I saw my friends posts, I decided to stop counting at 100. 

What's the point in following my friends on here if you're not gonna show me what they're posting? I'll be deleting the app until it's fixed.",2,2023-07-07 20:33:05
App Store,"Quite simply it keeps all your OG apps together in a sense: Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and now Threads (Twitter ran by an actual social media mogul) in Meta. If you want a smooth transition from Instagram to another way of expressing yourself via Threads, this is the app for you. Instagram links to Threads via your profile and vice versa making them simple extensions of each-other rather than being completely indifferent apps. Good Job so far 👌🏾",5,2023-07-06 01:30:41
App Store,"It’s a good app however it needs a lot of work and features that all other social networks have.

1. Chronological home feed so you can view thing in order.

2. For you feed so you ca see only the Threads from people you follow also in chronological order.

3. The ability to view the list of people you follow and ability to unfollow from the list.

4. The ability to view things you liked and favorited as a feed in your profile page.

These are major things that all other social networks have and Threads doesn’t have and for a lot of people that’s a deal breaker. I hope to see these features sooner rather then later because people WILL stop using this app and go back the the app Elon is currently hellbent on killing because there will be no better place.",3,2023-07-14 16:55:30

App Store,"This is almost a perfect replacement for Twitter minus one thing. This app needs a way to tell the algorithm to show fewer recommendations like these. Right now I have no way to train the algorithm to show me posts that would keep me scrolling.

How will social media take over the world if they can’t even design an app for big screen mobile users. I still have to suffer looking at Instagram with a screen smaller than my cell phone display. It’s not like Meta can’t afford to pay some brainiac for what could be a half an hours time to make the screen bigger. They’re making loads of cash.",3,2023-07-13 01:53:27
App Store,"Platform runs well. The first day of launch the algorithm focused on only the newest Threads being shared first, then it started older threads on day 2 which killed the vibe. 

Beyond that the app requires way to much invasion of personal privacy and information that Meta takes and sells to companies to use to target their consumers. Literally all of the data collected on you personal devices which also includes browsing history, apps used, time spent on those apps, ethnicity, religion, political party, and so much more.

Build on them slowly by suggesting related accounts overtime, sure. Stop bombarding me with irrelevance. It’s like driving on a road with so many billboards you can even see where you’re driving lol.

Some media (magazines, newspapers) may offer more topics of conversation, but it is still not clear what people who are not as focused on writing as they are on visuals might have to say about it.",2,2023-07-06 17:16:07

However,

I like to group accounts I follow so I can see only a few of them at a time.

For example:  if I was following a slew of newspapers and other media, I might have a group called “media.”  If I wanted to check up in what was happening in science lately, I would have a list named “science” which contained the accounts which posted mostly scientific discoveries and research.

I cannot stress how useful this grouping, filing or classification tool would be.  Without it, the information I receive is just jumbled and without order.

personally, i’d love to see the inclusion of a ‘people you follow’ timeline, bookmarks, the ability to see quotes on a thread, messaging and group chats, and more personalization on profiles such as location and a header. i think that with those additions (and others of course), people will begin to prefer what threads will have to offer and make the switch!

Would rather have control to chose what content I want and not have suggested content placed in my “thread.”

App Store,"As other short-form thread based platforms sink like the titanic, Threads rises from their ashes. There is as of yet no paywall, no verification to boost yourself to the top, no post-viewing limit, and most importantly the platform has a zero tolerance policy for hate speech.

App Store,"Spent hours scrolling on this app, no fear of being constantly cancelled like Twitter. A real safe space for philosophical thought.

I want Instagram to show me all posts by users I follow and in the order posted, not according to some imaginary idea of what an algorithm thinks I want to see. I would ask the same from Threads.",2,2023-07-10 20:41:30

Finally I deleted the odd man- the Threads cross over post and BAM, my posts popped back up. You’re welcome for that FREE information. Now if y’all could hire me since apparently y’all have a  billion dollars and can’t even figure out how to make your own app work with cross posting.

The problem with this: 
• the home feed is all just celebrities, influencers, and others I don’t really care about. Let me have a clear and clean home and let me decide who I want to add to the feed.

• the culture already feels wonky. Maybe it will change later, but I started to see the ugliness already come out in people. I’m sooooo over toxic spaces and I just don’t want to be in a place where anyone with an issue can project their anger at me and others.

• way too much data permissions. They basically ask permission for everything except your DNA. Also, if you want to remove that thread symbol from your IG, you’re told “if you do this you’ll NEVER get it back?” It feels so dramatic and hostile.

I don’t like that for some reason my thread badge won’t stay removed and keeps coming back on my instagram.

It need better organization and to be its own platform not conjoined at the hip of instagram.,2,2023-07-12 13:52:34
App Store,I was excited for this until i finally tried it. The app technically bring your IG followers with you which make it really lousy experience for those who looking for chance on a new platform. No clear guidelines on how to get your post in front of people. Hash tags dont work like twitter & no categories like IG. Worst of all you cant delete your account. Meta is desperate to claim they have many accounts by not letting people delete it unless they delete instagram. Dont bother install it. Pure waste of time.

1. Direct messaging - being able to share threads directly to someone’s inbox and chat back and forth. We all love getting those relatable reels from our friends every day, so why not do the same with threads?

2. Multiple accounts - to truly unify this as a Meta app, being able to log into multiple accounts and switch between them easily is a huge help for independent creators/business owners that need to share content between several different accounts.

Also, this does not need to be its own app. If it was an added feature to the Instagram app, it would make more sense, but unfortunately that is not the case.

For those of us who joined Threads to get a Twitter alternative, we may not have an interest in Instagram itself.

App Store,"I was looking forward to having a Twitter substitute for news and opinion. Sadly, Meta has explicitly stated this is not its goal. Moreover, it seems their algorithm is based on both your IG and Threads account. I follow pop culture on IG and wanted to use threads for news. But my entire Threads timeline seems to be recommendations based on my IG follows, not my Threads follows. My interest in the app is basically dead until reporters start using it and Meta is able to identify what a person wants to see on Threads specifically.",1,2023-07-10 17:37:34

 - Whenever I open the app, rather than letting me start from where I was it jumps up to a random point in the feed

 - No desktop version",3,2023-07-08 23:59:04

App Store,It has potential but they didnt fix what the issue was with twitter. You still can not edit a post after it has been shared. You also see a bunch of posts of accounts you are not following. Which defeats the purpose of trying to control the feed with things you chose.,3,2023-07-07 15:11:24
App Store,The app is very similar to twitter with very small changes. There are still lots of updates to be made so it’s not at its full potential and that’s why I have it rated at 4 stars right now because it’s still entertaining even at its early stages of development.,4,2023-07-14 13:28:36

1) a cleaned up and chronological timeline. Absolutely, under no circumstances, should we be seeing stuff from 1-2 days ago as the top threads that show up. Period. 
2) ability to see solely stuff from people that you follow
3) hashtags….
4) ability to search and subscribe to hashtags and key phrases

First, it seems glitchy. I’ve been doing a lot of searching to try to follow people I am following on Twitter and Mastodon. But I get error messages about too many searches.

Second, the feed needs to prioritize the people I follow, and put their unread posts first so I can see them. If you want to follow that with posts you think I might like, that’s okay. But show me posts from the people that follow first.

App Store,"its actually doing a good job at being a social media page that isnt so toxic. i am liking the setup with the link of every account going directly to their instagram, sometimes an instagram doesn’t let me know enough about someone like other social media sites, like twitter or tribel would. so having two combined is awesome and i actually enjoy this app more than the others. 

vice versa if i like someones threads, i can easily follow their instagram to support them. liking the idea so far!",5,2023-07-06 17:22:08

If you try to say something that Meta don’t like, your Threads account could be censored or banned. If banned, you can say also bye to your Instagram account.

Last thing, if you’re unable to post, like, follow and see your activity, it probably means that you’re in EU. Since this app doesn’t respect privacy rules, Meta has decided to block all EU users from using this app. And no, using a VPN doesn’t change nothing.",1,2023-07-18 23:23:36

- DM that’s connected to (same as) IG
- Stories (+ crossposting)
- Option for chronological/following-only newsfeed
- Hashtags
- Trending (or Threading 👀) topics
- Option to save/bookmark threads
- Option to edit threads

The App can be confusing, with messages from different people often scattered throughout the app.",2,2023-07-08 13:12:56
App Store,Everything else in the app works fine but if I try to post something it doesn’t work it just boots me out of it. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. It doesn’t work. I’ve tried restarting my phone. It doesn’t work either. Really annoying,2,2023-07-08 03:46:04
App Store,"Once you sign up through Instagram they won’t let you delete your threads account only “deactivate”. If you do delete it, you’re Instagram gets deleted!

I used it for 5 mins and was beyond disappointed. App is trash. Seems rushed out the gate. Obviously just a revenge app to get at Elon. Not a good quality product. Don’t sign up unless you want to be stuck with it. TRASH.",1,2023-07-07 01:44:12
App Store,The idea of migrating over from Twitter was nice but I’d rather be there interacting and looking at tweets my friends share than over here where my entire feed is ads and accounts I don’t even follow. Taking a break til they decide to adjust this,3,2023-07-06 15:11:59
App Store,"Absolutely no privacy with this company or app. From a person’s health and fitness data to financial info and everything in between, apparently all can be utilized by the Metaverse/Threads to sell to advertisers and who knows who else. 
Plus, there is no way to opt out or choose what information we want to share with this app. Simply by “joining” threads, all privacy is gone.",1,2023-07-06 16:05:21
App Store,"I love the app so far, it’s definitely the best I’ve seen for social media in a while. I wonder how it is going to hold up in the future?",5,2023-07-06 02:30:32
App Store,Can you please add the link for threads back as an option on our instagram profile to make it easier to access the threads app? Removing it decreased usage of the app,4,2023-07-23 01:19:10
App Store,I like it a lot but please make it chronologically ordered. I can’t stand the algorithm feeding me content from h large creators over and over again I just want to see posts from my friends when they post it.,4,2023-07-09 20:29:11
App Store,"Hello, Mr mark we I just need to say is thank you for this app and again another thing I think we still needed is a live video on WhatsApp.",5,2023-07-21 11:59:15
App Store,"Pros:
1. Easy to follow the community you’ve already built on Instagram

2. Posting is pretty straightforward 

Cons:
1. No functioning hashtags so hard to find community if you’re not already on Instagram 

2. No way to see the posts of people you’re actually following in your feed so it’s a bunch of noise from accounts you probably don’t care about 

3. No trending topics

4. No way to post from the web that’s not through the app

This needs a lot of work to truly replace Twitter but the built in community aspect makes it an easy sell. I’m not sure I’ll use it beyond sign up if the cons aren’t fixed soon, though.",1,2023-07-10 01:39:17
App Store,"Right now they do have much and I’m glad they started off strong and will add stuff later on, but when this app starts adding more to it maybe it will be a 5. But so far this app is awesome.",4,2023-07-07 20:25:56
App Store,"When I turn on post notifications for someone, then turn them off, I still get the notifications to my phone. There must be a bug in the system.",3,2023-07-08 14:56:38
App Store,I have yet to find the option for when you have multiple accounts but I’m excited for what’s in store.,4,2023-07-07 18:33:13
App Store,"It seems like a really promising app but it glitches when you go to change your pfp/bio so whatever you preset it to is what you’re stuck with for the time being. Otherwise, it’s promising.",4,2023-07-07 14:29:16
App Store,"Due to all the promo and advertising Facebook has done to promote this app, I decided to download this app yesterday night. Big mistake.

Getting onto the app, there’s literally nothing and I mean NOTHING go for it that’s new or good. It is literally a Twitter clone with stripped down features.

As for the community, once you’re actually in it you are left to ask, what community? There is none. Think about it; the majority of this app is insta users. If that doesn’t scream bad to you I don’t know what does.

But that’s not the worst part. Take one look at the data they collect or their ToS and you will faint. It’s literally a data miner.",1,2023-07-07 18:21:42
App Store,"It’s a really nice app, small and easy to use. But there’s one thing you need to add to the app. I was trying to pin a thread to my profile and I couldn’t. Can you please add a thread button so we can pin threads to profiles?",4,2023-07-07 13:43:13
App Store,"I’m dissatisfied that it doesn’t have options to customize your timeline.
I also wish I could search up people on Facebook and Instagram to see their accounts (even if they don’t have a threads).
The moderation/algorithm needs work asap 
I immediately got transphobic creators and it really scared me to see what these people could say about other people

The lack of moderation right now and the timeline are my main complaints
Other than that I’m happy to finally stop using twitter.",3,2023-07-06 12:36:19
App Store,"App has worked seamlessly, still has some growing to do but, for now, is a must have must use.",5,2023-07-06 19:49:40
App Store,"Much more good and amazing than twitter. 
On twitter it feels like u r lost and no body knows you. But here i feel more connected with friends and more happier. 
Good work team Meta.",5,2023-07-06 19:48:42
App Store,"""The user interface in the application needs more organization and arrangement. I hope to see its development in the first update, and I also hope for the addition of a feature (Direct message).""",3,2023-07-16 10:35:06
App Store,"I have hope they get this app to be something presentable, but the entire home feed is random people, not the people I follow. They threads also seem to be from random times. I’m amazed these billionaires haven’t figured out a way to monetize what literally everyone wants - a chronological feed from people you follow.",2,2023-07-06 09:12:44
App Store,needs a improvement on the like button being able to pressed in real time,5,2023-07-05 23:58:24
App Store,"I’m gaining followers way more than on Twitter and Instagram. So far I’ve been having a pleasant experience. Not many trolls on Threads, yet.",5,2023-07-21 02:01:08
App Store,Anything that gives a big middle finger to musk it’s excellent in my book. Hope to see it bring down twitter one day.,5,2023-07-10 04:09:37
App Store,"This app puts google to shame for what it collects on you. No app is worth this amount of access.. Several million have already made the mistake of putting their real info into this, don’t be one of them. Wasn’t this supposed to be “safe” you are handing them ALL info on your device, no literally, all of it.",1,2023-07-12 04:14:54
App Store,"It’s great that we’re able to follow all our instagram connections on threads with just one click but here is a bug: 

All the people that I already was following on instagram, received multiple back to back “follow requests” from me on instagram all over again, when I started using threads. 

Now my notifications tab is blowing up with multiple “your connection request has been accepted” notifications from Instagram!!! 

So much for “Threads, an instagram app”. Deleted my threads profile and uninstalled the app but the notification madness on instagram is still going on.",1,2023-07-10 05:12:39
App Store,Overall I like the app but it needs to add some features such as editing threads and editing the feed to where it only shows feeds of accounts you follow.,4,2023-07-06 17:05:32
App Store,"I downloaded the app & after an hour of having it - my IG is all messed up. Cant see profile pics, profiles, messages, story’s, feed, nothing - it isn’t compatible for some reason. I’ll wait until they fix all the bugs to re-download. Super disappointed :/ Hopefully logging out and removing the app will fix my IG. 🤞🏼",1,2023-07-09 22:34:11
App Store,"i just wanted to get it to see what it was abt, but now i can’t delete my account? i can only “disable” it. at least make it to where you can delete your account, yk, like ANY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. also u cant find ur friends on here unless u already did when u first joined, makes no sense why you don’t have a icon to find ur friends . overall, bummy.",1,2023-07-07 13:14:56
App Store,Can I post art that is not safe for work? So many of us artists used tumblr then instagram then twitter. We don’t have a place to post drawn works of art that depict the natural human body. It’s all considered p**n to the algorithm. Hoping this place allows it,3,2023-07-07 11:44:34
App Store,"Idk what to say it’s just exactly like Twitter with slightly a different interface. If you could make it where the home page is showing ONLY the people you follow that would be cool

I really don’t care much about the app one way or another lol",3,2023-07-07 04:17:57
App Store,Cool concept (stolen from Twitter) but i don’t like the fact that i can’t even see the content from people i chose to follow. My whole feed is random accounts idc to see. If you want to stand out and possibly be better stop forcing unwanted content on our feeds I’d like to just see the people i follow,2,2023-07-07 03:16:22
App Store,"Threads is an exceptional social media app. With its intuitive design, diverse features, vibrant community, and seamless integration, it stands out as a top choice for connecting and engaging with others. Highly recommended!",5,2023-07-07 03:05:01
App Store,"Should be easier to unmute videos on a thread. Even when double clicking/expanding the video it stays muted and unmuting it is a hassle.

Given many people are attaching vids, this is a pain point in the ux design. 3 stars because of that.",3,2023-07-07 01:29:58
App Store,"I downloaded the threads app, was logged in just fine. I even made two posts.
Now, every time I tap the icon to create a post, or to comment on a thread, I'm kicked off the app and find myself on my iPad home screen.
Problems happen. I understand that.
But I hope there's a fix to this soon. 
I'll give one star because I can't give none.",1,2023-07-06 22:19:05
App Store,"Pretty much title.  Reverse-crono feed, searching for topics, re-Thread counts.. some bugs with turning video sound on/off.

App Store,"I don’t know if this review will be used against me in the future.
But, for now; I’m enjoying every second of being on threads.",5,2023-07-06 15:02:45
App Store,"Really don’t like how it shows accounts that you haven’t followed on your home page. Definitely needs a way to only posts from those you follow— or better yet, a separate Home Screen for that purpose.",3,2023-07-06 07:24:56
App Store,So I had this app for 16 months at this point and it feels kind of off. Like it works well but for some reason I feel like it’s mooched off of Twitter idk why,5,2023-07-06 07:09:29
App Store,This app is looking so well put together. Others similarly related to apps are going to have a difficult time returning their customers.,5,2023-07-06 05:31:57
App Store,"Where can I see posts I’ve liked on Threads? Also, kinda awkward how similar this is to Twitter… Not sure what purpose this app is serving that is different from its competitor. Unnecessary division and conflict if you ask me. Clearly an agenda is behind this app and it’s incredibly obvious.",3,2023-07-14 23:15:55
App Store,"You don’t see posts from people you follow unless you look them up every single time. Also, my feed is only far left politics. I don’t follow any sort of political stuff on any social media, and have never even googled politics. Never have, never will. I hate when companies try to force their political opinions down your throat.",1,2023-07-21 05:12:03
App Store,Can we get both these features?? I need to know how many times my threads are seen! Thank you!!!,5,2023-07-17 05:54:58
App Store,"Worked for me for about 48 hours then I was no longer able to see my threads, my interactions were not loading, and I was unable to create new threads. 

I reported it somehow through the app. Wish me luck.

Otherwise seems like a nice new app",2,2023-07-16 04:42:23
App Store,I really liked the app but I was wondering can someone have more than one account on the same phone.,5,2023-07-12 20:27:05
App Store,"Horrid layout, hard to find accounts you actually care about, half the stuff in your timeline are random brain rotting crap from accounts you don’t even follow, no hashtags, horrible search feature, no desktop website, collects a lot of personal data, etc.

This app is pretty trash and doesn’t have a future.",1,2023-07-10 19:55:18
App Store,This app is great except the activity section doesnt load for me other than that its a great place to connect and it's basically a way better less racist transphobic white-man driven version of twitter lol,4,2023-07-07 07:48:33
App Store,"When I downloaded the app and linked it to my Instagram, it requested to follow every person on my Instagram again and gave them a notification. It does nothing I still follow them but now they are all getting a notification and I am getting spammed by follow accept notifications.",1,2023-07-07 19:32:40
App Store,"Solid app, not great yet. Seems like Facebook has been building this app for a month or two and then just decided to use the timing of Twitter limiting tweets to launch before it is fully ready. I see the potential",3,2023-07-07 00:53:25
App Store,With some more updates this app can be a lot better than it already is including a following tab to see threads from all the people you’re following and then boom the app is set,3,2023-07-06 16:38:25

App Store,"Please for the sake of your right to privacy don’t download this app. It’s a surveillance app. Just look at the permissions it asks for ; literally everything.

Sony boycott this suzkerbug app.",1,2023-07-06 14:27:11
App Store,"This era of social media we’re entering is scary. These corporations truly won’t stop copying anything that works until every product is an exact clone of each other.

So far, this app is just twitter but with less features so I give it a 1 star. But just wait until Threads implements “stories” from Instagram or the “news” page from snapchat.",1,2023-07-06 08:08:49
App Store,"I’ll change my rating when they remove the nasty background when I share something to Instagram story. Let me be change the background color or something.

App Store,"Thought it would be a good twitter alternative, but I was wrong. This app doesn’t cater to what and who I want to follow. It only shows me celebrities and people that I don’t know or care about. 
 Not to mention it inspires people to block each other so it’s a heavily cancel culture/censorship medium. You will be blocked if you say anything against the politically correct opinion/narrative. 

 If you think for yourself this app is not for you! 

Say goodbye to conspiracy theories, nuance ideas, and constructive debates. Say hello to an echo chamber of boredom.",2,2023-07-09 16:13:07
App Store,"love the app, but i am absolutely not a fan, as many people i know, that you cannot ever delete or deactivate it without deleting and activating your IG account. that’s stupid if you ask me. i do not like this at all. please fix this now.

App Store,I’ve opened this up on my iPad and like Instagram it only covers about one third of the screen. That makes trying to view or read anything extremely difficult. I need full screen access to be able to enjoy this app.,2,2023-07-07 15:00:10

App Store,This app is literally a copy cat of Twitter. Nothing about it is original. I’m suprised Twitter can’t sue for how similar the app is layed out. My threads account is connected to my Instagram and in order to delete my account on threads I would have to do so to my Instagram. Are you serious…. I regret being curious and downloading it. The badge won’t leave my Instagram bio. I hate it.,1,2023-07-06 22:11:34
App Store,"You can’t delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram account as well, they only allow you to ‘temporarily deactivate”. You also can’t remove the threads badge in your Instagram bio after you make an account, even if you ‘temporarily deactivate’. The app is also buggy",1,2023-07-06 21:50:22

App Store,"It doesn’t feel like a fully-fleshed out app. It’s missing some critical features that make it unusable for me personally. I want my social media to only show me posts from people I follow, in chronological order. Threads does not do that, so I won’t be using it.",2,2023-07-06 03:49:20

App Store,I said it before and I’ll say it again. Stop letting companies profit off of your personal information and everyday interactions. We already did the Twitter and Facebook thing.

I hope they are planning to drastically improve the search function so users can search words, phrases, hashtags — as well as for other users.

Very promising, but a few key tweaks are needed.",3,2023-07-06 05:58:55

App Store,Please as a feature to be able to direct message.,4,2023-07-07 17:00:00
App Store,"Why can’t i upload my profile picture? 
I tried syncing with Instagram but the profile pic isn’t working",4,2023-07-07 09:57:57
App Store,"Have you ever wondered what twitter would be like if it was run by a suppressive socialist or fascist government? Wonder no longer. Who cares about freedom of speech when you disagree with those whose speech is being suppressed. Threads is a joke on twitter as everyone joins threads, states an unpopular opinion to gets instantly blocked or suspended so they can post a screenshot of their suspension on twitter.",1,2023-07-07 16:13:01
App Store,"I haven’t been called a slur yet, or seen anything crazy, but there are a lot of annoying brands and celebrities, so maybe being called a slur isn’t so bad",4,2023-07-07 08:34:15
App Store,"Great experience bc it’s new. It’s very fun but it freezes a lot. That’s my only complaint. And the people on my feed page, I would like to see the people I follow only.",3,2023-07-07 03:28:09
App Store,Would be nice if developers could add the option on dm like instagram and chats where u can add certain people in,5,2023-07-07 04:16:43
App Store,Literally when I downloaded this app I immediately switched from Twitter to Threads in a matter of 5 secs! Loving it!!!,5,2023-07-06 18:53:47
App Store,"Hi! When i try to log in to my account; it doesn’t open and tell me i’m Community banned and it is limited so i should try it later. How can i open this when it’s trended right now ?! It’s Horrible interpretation of Twitter made by Mark, honestly i can’t stand it when it doesn’t open. I don’t recommend this 👎🏻",1,2023-07-06 10:32:15
App Store,Please stop recommending account that I don't follow so often. Or at least make an option to know which account we wish to see. It's really bad.,3,2023-07-08 17:52:11
App Store,"How are you not going to have an option to only view posts from the people you follow? What makes you think your algorithm knows what I like better than I do? On the other hand, it’s not owned by Elon, which is a plus",2,2023-07-06 10:04:27
App Store,They did the right move at the right time.,5,2023-07-06 02:05:01
App Store,"Discovery feels nigh impossible, you have to know user names. You can’t even search for content. Can’t even save images. Not optimized for iPad. Didn’t bother going any further. Ranked in terms of egregiousness.

This is Meta, a multi billion dollar social media company. This isn’t their first rodeo, so I find these unacceptable.",1,2023-07-21 10:12:49
App Store,I woulda went four stars but there is someone with a copycat app. Threads is a good app. Better than Twitter in a few ways. Twitter is garbage now. Im Threading exclusively. More streamlined. Simpler.,5,2023-07-15 04:42:52
App Store,Share content with your friends. Meta actually sent a survey for me asking if they’re making trends or following trends and I have to say they’re definitely following trends they just find any app they want to replicate and replace and it’s not even a good version of Twitter.,2,2023-07-14 02:22:35
App Store,"This app has potential, but it has a plethora of UX issues—I have very little control over my feed, there are concerns over accessibility and performance, and a lack of transparency around data usage and privacy, just to name a few. It’s not the “Twitter killer” that it is claimed to be, at least not yet.",1,2023-07-10 01:54:21
App Store,Threads destroyed my ability to post on Instagram. On Twitter some say they have the same problem. I can only post Stories. No photos. Instagram will not let me remove the Threads badge now. My Instagram worked until this. It’s been a full day! Save yourself the trouble and don’t use Threads.,1,2023-07-09 20:34:59
App Store,This must be planned as a refuge for people who couldn’t handle free speech and still wear masks in their car. Exact copy of Twitter but with more pics and your feed filled with people you don’t know. Uninspired and and buggy. If you have Instagram this is very redundant. Basic Twitter with some Instagram painted over it.,1,2023-07-09 16:20:47
App Store,"Fine app, will see how it evolves but at the moment there is no option to change the background color and it is set to a really harsh white.",3,2023-07-05 23:26:12

I just downloaded it not too long ago but i am already getting addicted to this app lol",5,2023-07-07 07:53:35

App Store,I have multiple accounts and would love to have the same option as instagram to switch accounts without having to login/logout each time!,2,2023-07-06 21:23:05
App Store,I’m excited for this app but the MAJORITY of my feed is people I don’t follow and brands! Please stop. I don’t want those on my home page. I’m happy to check recommended content on an explore page but what’s the point of choosing who to follow if the app is going to decide what I’m going to see for me??,1,2023-07-06 16:17:46
App Store,"This is definitely an early tech demo/alpha release. Lots of core functionality missing, like a web UI, native iPad layout, chronological timeline, ability to mute words, DMs, etc. I will check it out again once they get a feature-complete v1 released, but seems like it will be a bit before that happens",1,2023-07-06 01:19:10
App Store,"I love it, Better than others",5,2023-07-06 00:27:10
App Store,"I just downloaded this app and I have nothing to browse. I don’t want to see only what the people I follow post, there needs to be an explore page when you can browse things/comments to your liking.",2,2023-07-05 23:56:26
App Store,5 seconds in to the app…its exactly like twitter but just different looking. Functionality its the same. no ads🤷‍♂️,5,2023-07-05 23:44:03
App Store,"App only worked for a week after release. Cannot post, view replies or activity. Constant errors. Content not available. Oops, something went wrong. Try again. I have uninstalled/installed app. Rebooted device. Updated app. Nothing works to fix the problem.",1,2023-07-23 23:34:18
App Store,"I haven’t been able to post, view comments or my profile for weeks now. My feed is full of poeple I don’t even follow. Pointless app. Should have launched when all the bugs were fixed. How are you going to launch a app that does not work?",1,2023-07-23 17:01:57
App Store,Wish there was a way to see the threads I’ve liked! This is so frustrating that I can’t view them,4,2023-07-07 15:31:00
App Store,I don’t like the new update. I liked the number in everyone’s instagram bios and I think everyone else agrees. This app is going downhill. It’s a twitter wannabe when it could have been twitter wanting to be,3,2023-07-17 09:44:47
App Store,Feed is filled with things I do not follow.  I don’t think I have came across an account I follow unless I manually search for the person or account.  I don’t understand what the hype is here and I hope these issues are fixed soon to put accounts followed in chronological timeline.,1,2023-07-16 15:46:08
App Store,The Thread number badge that indicates the number of people who have joined Threads before you does not show up in my Instagram. The only this that shows up in my bio is the Treads badge with no number. Hoping this glitch can be fixed.,2,2023-07-12 23:25:03
App Store,I absolutely love this app and the people here are nice. I can’t wait to see what new updates bring to the app.,5,2023-07-10 00:24:15
App Store,"Such a great app so far, still needs updates like follower feed but overall is fantastic.",5,2023-07-08 10:14:05
App Store,It’s nice but I don’t like seeing other people’s accounts that I don’t follow or have any relevance to the accounts I follow it makes me really mad honestly.,4,2023-07-07 04:56:44
App Store,Let it be just for sharing what’s on our minds. Keep instagram for photos. Don’t let what so called influencers ruin the app for their ego boost likes and comments,3,2023-07-07 07:50:27
App Store,"Everything else is very convenient, but it's not easy to use without an interpreter.",4,2023-07-07 02:32:35
App Store,"Unable to enlarge profile photos, makes me hard to tell even familiar instagram friends. Main page filled up with threads from ppl I’m not following or interested in, almost impossible to find threads from ppl I followed.",2,2023-07-07 04:05:39
App Store,"Seems like a good Twitter replacement. but as a person whose main use of social media is following sports, it really needs the chronological timeline",4,2023-07-09 17:59:02
App Store,It’s a new app that doesn’t let you import your followers so you start from scratch and then they limit how many people you can follow. No way to be found with hashtags. Just another algorithm hiding your existence. Another place to get barely any likes. Having fun yet? No.,1,2023-07-07 00:26:51
App Store,Great app! Its like for people who don’t like twitter because of their political beliefs but all in all its chill im sure censorship will be at its worst around the next presidential race in usa.,5,2023-07-06 17:00:32
App Store,You know it's fresh when there ain't no reviews. This review is subject to change lol,5,2023-07-06 08:27:55
App Store,I really like the app so far and I think its better than twitter but the timeline is mess. No point in following people because its just filled with everyone. Needs to be a filter feature,3,2023-07-06 03:27:08
App Store,"I’m sure if you’re used to Twitter it’s good, but I really don’t like that there aren’t separate “explore” and “following” pages. I don’t like seeing posts from random accounts I don’t follow",3,2023-07-23 23:13:27
App Store,"You have to have an instagram account to use this.  It feels like what should be a part of the instagram app, but just carved out so it can be advertised as something new and cool. It’s really just a set of basic features that should be part of instagram.",1,2023-07-18 12:31:55
App Store,Looking forward to the updates as this grows,5,2023-07-10 02:23:43
App Store,The app is super legit; attaching music like in the stories of ig in the posts would take it to the next level. 🆙,5,2023-07-09 16:01:33
App Store,"What exactly does a social media app whose purpose is text chat threads need permission for “Health and Fitness data”?  This is a Facebook app after all so I can’t be surprised.

Wait till it integrates with ActivityPub which they claim to be planning to do.  Then use a Mastodon server that respects your privacy to access Threads content.",1,2023-07-09 10:20:54
App Store,"i downloaded this app to see what it was all about, it’s basically the instagram version of twitter. once i decided i didn’t want to have that app, i tried to deactivate my profile. the threads number also appears on my instagram bio, which i don’t want it to. i tried to deactivate my threads profile and hide the badge on my instagram bio, but it won’t go away.",4,2023-07-08 04:42:15

App Store,"The app has already been filled with spam bots, algorithms and reels. If you download you can’t delete your account without deleting your IG page. The app also accessed apps it shouldn’t to gather information about you. 
There are so many cons about this app. Do your research before you download!!",1,2023-07-08 01:36:21
App Store,Can’t wait to see how this all develops. The only thing I would like is the option to search different topics.,4,2023-07-09 03:44:20

I’ll edit my review as soon as they allow for account creation via Apple.",1,2023-07-06 13:21:11
App Store,it would be a nice app if it didn’t keep logging me out my Instagram.,5,2023-07-06 07:22:55
App Store,Forced to follow random accounts. No customization options. No lists or separate views. No sorting. Friends aren't floated to the top. No nsfw content. Your scroll placement isn't saved. The feed refreshes whenever you click anything and then you got random posts again. It's not a good app.,1,2023-07-06 00:27:22
App Store,"For over two weeks now and even with the latest update, have been unable to post, see comments on posts, or see any of my activity. 

Have reported multiple times, but no help or anything. Worst app launch ever.",1,2023-07-24 19:23:53
App Store,"Try to follow accounts but they just get drowned out in THE ALGORITHM’s torrent. At least give us an option to go a following feed.

It’s still better than Twitter/X, but then so is the clap, so 🤷‍♂️",3,2023-07-24 17:56:17
App Store,"There’s barely any upvotes on posts or comments, and most of the posts are from companies or feels artificial. The service was booming when it came out but now everyone left and the hype has died off, which is unfortunate because it looks like i’m back to Twitter 🫤",1,2023-07-19 19:45:43
App Store,"Not a very good app. Just people self promoting and saying dumb things. They also don’t let you delete your account, and if you delete the app you can’t delete the badge from your Instagram account if you delete the Threads app so you’re basically a permanent advertisement…",1,2023-07-11 20:13:33
App Store,"We need an iPad app pronto in my opinion, i feel like Instagram not having one has been annoying and if this is meant to be adopted widely and taken seriously it should cater to all screens.",3,2023-07-09 03:05:09
App Store,Most of the content on my feed is from accounts I do not follow and there is no option to change my content preferences.,3,2023-07-07 00:02:31
App Store,The amount of data this app collects from you is absurd and you can’t delete your Threads profile without also deleting Instagram. This is nothing but a trap set up by Zuckerberg to siphon as much user data as possible,2,2023-07-07 13:14:37
App Store,"App has been out for less than 24 hours and already has a porn bit problem. Within 14 minutes of me making my account I had 4 bots following me, and so far 13/14 of my followers are bots (account has been up for less than 10 hours)",1,2023-07-07 10:16:22

Its just the worst that no where in the app does it inform you that if you die on Threads, you die in real life. I'm dead now and seething with rage!

App Store,This app just benefits lefty wing politicians and actors and actresses and influencers withy he algorithm. Many but many of the right wing ones that have over 60k followed on thread barely get 4 likes in their comments or posts. This is so odd. Also the app is freaking boring. I’ve heard this from both right and left.,1,2023-07-17 12:39:06

App Store,"I do like IT, although it crashes so many times on my se2020",5,2023-07-07 21:14:02
App Store,Y’all in these reviews just hating this the best thing instagram has done so far no need to complain,5,2023-07-07 20:55:26
App Store,You should be able to set up an account independent of Instagram. It’s obnoxious and super lame that the only way you can login is to use an Instagram account. It’s a pathetic move. I don’t care what the underlying motivation is for Meta it’s a stupid move.,1,2023-07-07 19:24:00
App Store,Seems that it’s impossible for me to be signed in to both threads and Instagram. If I login to threads and then open the Instagram app I find that I’ve been logged out of Instagram. If I then login to Instagram and open threads I find that I’ve been logged out of threads. Please fix this!,1,2023-07-07 16:30:11
App Store,"Information overload. I see a lot of post in the feed that I don't care about, just wanna see my favorites and maybe threads that people I follow reply on. It's a great concept but just way too much information in the feed and it's hard to process.",1,2023-07-07 12:26:19
App Store,"Hashtags don’t work. Link I gave to Linktree had a Threads link to get back. Links open in Threads ecosystem, not Safari, and the link back to Threads FROM Linktree doesn’t work. Musicians should be able to get verified. Threads does not indicate any way to get verified. Looking forward to Threads improving upon all of this.",1,2023-07-07 05:39:09
App Store,I haven’t had Instagram in forever. I was hoping to check out what this app was like but I can’t even make an account once I download it. You have to log in with an Instagram account. Kinda lame. I’m not going to download Instagram just to use this.,1,2023-07-07 00:35:46
App Store,It’s just started but I have hope.  Strange day I’m rooting for Meta but it’s against Musk.  So here’s my review.,5,2023-07-06 22:05:42
App Store,Better than having to deal with the freaking post limit on Twitter...,5,2023-07-06 20:49:30
App Store,I like the new app which can let you write a thread which can be similar to Twitter and it looks great 👍,5,2023-07-06 05:28:47
App Store,"This app needs to be useful to be successful.
No hashtags, lame algorithmic timeline with no other choices and lots of junk content similar to Instagram.
Sorry, you are missing your chance to replace Twitter.",2,2023-07-19 07:45:15
App Store,"So I’ve been dabbling with this app for a few days now, and have decided that it is pretty lame. It’s basically just a bad version of Twitter. If you’re a super sensitive cry baby, you might like it. I think free speech is pretty cool though, so this app is a flop for me.",2,2023-07-18 19:43:42

App Store,I think they should allow were u can dm other people privately,4,2023-07-09 08:30:40
App Store,"Just take a look at the sheer amount of privacy and data you have to surrender even before using the app. And for what? A post + thread environment with no additional functions.

This app doesn’t require a fraction of the data it says it needs for use.",1,2023-07-10 19:44:58
App Store,"I can like but I can't comment, when I click the comments button it kicks me out of the app. Any tips?",4,2023-07-07 23:55:10
App Store,I love the vibes here! Definitely a better twitter. I hated the spam dms and here they are no messages!!!😊 we just need an unfollower app ASAP,5,2023-07-08 23:34:40
App Store,Super easy log in but It crashes every time I click the make a post button,3,2023-07-08 21:38:51
App Store,"obviously this is designed to be a - much needed - competitor to twitter as it circles the drain, but so far it is not up to speed. most of what i see on my feed is accounts i do not follow and have no interest in. this is the biggest reason i won’t be using the app until this improves. as another review said there’s no dm option or group chat option either id assume?",3,2023-07-08 16:00:37
App Store,"Of course it needs a lot of upgrades  for example interaction sounds,gifs,the ability to customize the feed and preferences but overall it's a nice app.",3,2023-07-08 15:51:09
App Store,"The app is great, but it is lacking a key feature.

The app needs some way to only see people you follows posts",4,2023-07-07 00:27:45
App Store,"I just found out that if I want to delete my account, even though I never actually created one, I can’t do it unless I also delete my Instagram profile in the process… I might do it, even when I risk losing all my media in my ig profile.",1,2023-07-07 22:56:12
App Store,"Obviously there are things that can be improved on, but this is an awesome start! Love this more than Twitter!",5,2023-07-07 01:27:44
App Store,"It's a Twitter clone, but it's pretty good. It needs a way to only see threads from people you follow and to sort by most recent.",4,2023-07-06 06:03:10
App Store,"app is brand new and exciting, but leaves some MUCH desired & essential features such as:

a follow back button
2 separate following & “explore” feeds

App Store,I am about to download this app and am already hooked.,5,2023-07-06 17:56:56
App Store,Like the concept so far … looks like the biggest group,5,2023-07-06 16:35:37
App Store,Please give us the option to filter out threads we don’t follow so we’re able focus and respond to our friends only if we want to. It’s giving instagram ads on week 1,2,2023-07-06 16:18:30
App Store,"I was looking forward to using a new platform since I have been banned multiple accounts on Twitter (while Far-Right, MAGA, Insurrectionists get their accounts reinstated). The thing is you need to have an instagram account to create a Threads account. Definitely a non starter.",1,2023-07-06 13:44:36
App Store,"I am loving the new platform, but there is something essential missing for global communities - translation options!

On that other app (you know what I’m talking about), there is a built in translate feature, and i am also able to use apple’s translate feature because i can select text and choose “translate”.

This is going to be essential for quick conversions.

Thanks, loving it so far!",3,2023-07-06 11:56:45
App Store,Miles and miles better.,5,2023-07-06 10:36:10
App Store,I’ve worn out the mute button over the past four hours since I joined. Give us a fully customizable feed and you’ll get your stars. We also need a media tab on profiles and DMs.,2,2023-07-06 05:43:06
App Store,"So far not bad, it's easy since you can connect it with your Instagram seamlessly. Now this makes me look forward to Musk vs Zuck 🥊 even more.",4,2023-07-06 00:56:28
App Store,I would like to be the first to review. I can't believe we have an alternative to twitter that is actually digestible and free of hatespeech,5,2023-07-06 04:36:47
App Store,"Always dislike how difficult twitter was to use, this makes it easy — love it!!",5,2023-07-06 03:36:31
App Store,But honestly kinda wild and boring one cannot have a chronological timeline. For now I pass while keeping my acc just in case. Also it’d be nice if the app didn’t collect this tremendous amount of data.,3,2023-07-06 02:04:33
App Store,"i don’t want to see random people on my feed. please fix immediately, i only want to see people i follow.",4,2023-07-08 16:49:48
App Store,"It needs recommended content in the discover area, it’s just a search bar for people. It does not allow to search keywords or use hashtags. 

It needs a popular topics area, like the 
Trending area, it only 1 feed (similar to Instagram’s feed)

It’s not a separate app like Facebook it’s to Instagram, it’s an extension of Instagram in a separate app.

At the moment, Twitter still the better options unless you are famous with a lot of followers.",2,2023-07-06 00:51:31
App Store,"Whenever I try and see them, it says sorry try again",3,2023-07-23 14:47:08
App Store,Glad this exists because Twitter is on the way out but this should not have launched until they were ready with all features.  No hashtags.  No trending topics.  No searchable topics.  No DMs.  If this is supposed to be a twitter copy but better then make it better!!!,1,2023-07-20 11:17:55
App Store,"Sure there’s potential (it can’t be that hard to make a twitter clone), but it will not be useable until it has the option for a chronological timeline with only accounts I follow. Also, no website? Pull it together.",1,2023-07-18 04:41:56
App Store,Instagram and Threads run on iPad but look unprofessional. Check out what some other devs are doing for the bigger screen - including twitter - for good interface ideas.,3,2023-07-08 21:25:38
App Store,It’s like Twitter but I don’t want to crash my car at full speed into a brick wall. Five stars.,5,2023-07-08 18:10:43

App Store,"i mean it’s better than twitter, you can interact with alot of people including celebrities just like yall are friends, some people say things should be added but idk i think the app is fine the way it is, it’s interesting fr and i hope it don’t die down cause we havin a good time on here 😂😂😂",5,2023-07-08 12:42:11

App Store,"(Im the first review) I never used instagram in my life only once to sign up and i dont even know my login. Im not about to download 2 apps just to use one.

App Store,"It’s pointless, to a certain degree. If you want to read about the news then Threads is for you. Pictures are included, but it still does not tell the story is visual setting. It reminds me of blank twitter. The screen is all white. There isn’t any color to draw me to the new, news.

App Store,"Good concept to try and have a Twitter feel, but the homepage shows literally NO posts from accounts I’m following. Just random ones. I don’t understand why these apps think we want constant suggestions and not just show us what we follow???????",1,2023-07-06 20:26:51

App Store,This app was only created because since elon bought twitter & exposed how social media platforms sell out to the government & suppress freedom of speech!! I hope this app fails which I know it won’t because of all the brainwashed people in this country but that’s life,1,2023-07-08 10:02:09
App Store,This isn’t a standalone product. You have to make an instagram account to use it. It’s only meant to be a way to increase new accounts for IG.

App Store,"I like the app and interacting on it. It’s way better than Twitter because it’s not a toxic cesspool like Twitter and to a lesser extent Instagram.

App Store,Who’s idea was it to release a new app without any way to create a new account for it? Am I expected to download Instagram so that I can sign up there? Absolutely ridiculous for a new platform trying to establish itself.,1,2023-07-09 01:56:12

App Store,Seamless interface with Instagram and better than Twitter,5,2023-07-07 02:09:19
App Store,I dont know about you. This is app is working very well,5,2023-07-07 00:05:48
App Store,"This app is awesome. Let’s move off greedy Twitter run by a lunatic, everyone.",5,2023-07-06 23:08:56
App Store,the threads community would REALLY love an inbox where we can reply to peoples threads & have conversations privately.,5,2023-07-06 22:19:53
App Store,"Are hashtags gonna be added to this app? Other than that, I really like this app. 😁",5,2023-07-06 16:02:58
App Store,The home feed is full of people I do not follow and do not care to hear from. If it would only show the people I follow in chronological order then it would be amazing!,2,2023-07-06 21:57:53
App Store,"Loving the vibe, the celebrities and the app overall with its tens of tiny hidden delights. Twi… who? Threads is here to stay!",5,2023-07-06 13:00:20
App Store,"Looks good, please add group chat and top trend section❤️",5,2023-07-06 10:09:58
App Store,This is the next big thing in social media. Well done.,5,2023-07-06 03:09:14
App Store,"Well I decided to give this a shot, within the first five minutes, I’m blocking a lot of accounts that I do not care for so basically this will be like Facebook and Instagram were you see ads every 3 to 4 posts.",1,2023-07-06 04:24:47
App Store,Haven’t been on the app yet but if it’s anything like 2013 twitter you’re a winner.,5,2023-07-06 01:59:12
App Store,"Great idea but friends are hard to discover on the app,",5,2023-07-06 00:33:34
App Store,If I hide it from my account is there a way to get it back?,4,2023-07-06 21:23:18
App Store,It's good so far but it need to add a little more features. Like for you thread and Follow thread. The threads need to be in order.,5,2023-07-06 00:22:47
App Store,"Been in the app for 30 seconds, my feed is full of blue checkmarks that I don’t follow and can’t seem to unfollow. Refreshed my feed and saw an obvious scam. This app has been live for what, an hour? 

Why is it so hard to only show the people I want to follow in my feed?",1,2023-07-05 23:38:37
App Store,I love the idea of threads and I would prefer it over twitter but I hate the fact that I do NOT see any posts from the ones I follow. I DONT care about the #foryou. I want to support my friends….,2,2023-07-19 21:44:17
App Store,"Probably launched way too soon, right now it is just a dump of everything. Just pure garbage content dump to make it feel busy.

No search, no specific interest topics, no followers only, nothing.",1,2023-07-16 14:09:02
App Store,"On Friday July 14, we got an update. Now my feed is full of accounts I don’t follow. Like on day one. Horrible. Willing to give some time but first update makes it all worse?",2,2023-07-15 04:31:45
App Store,Please in posts and reply button add reaction .,5,2023-07-12 16:26:20
App Store,I remember back in the day when we use to copy CD’s with CDburners and sometimes copying just failed and it didn’t work. A lot of missing features that twitter has. Also why would anyone signup for another censored social media app.,1,2023-07-11 03:15:30
App Store,Fine for folks that live on their phone but for “the rest of us” the lack of a web interface makes it useless.,1,2023-07-10 14:38:31
App Store,Projects need to get off Twitter and stop requiring Twitter and move to threads or lens Phaver,5,2023-07-09 18:59:23
App Store,"Sorry just gonna say it. I hate it I tried and tried but this app was worse then when twitter was owned by the previous twitter owner. At least the OG app *cough**cough* twitter shows more promise than this. And truth be told ""Threads"" came and started on twitter. Sorry dudes",1,2023-07-09 15:54:37
App Store,Overall I would not waste your time on this one. It is very similar to other apps and really adds nothing original.  Very low creative content as well.,1,2023-07-08 19:13:07
App Store,Twitter can go eat a d*** so here’s to hoping this works 🤞🤞🤞,5,2023-07-07 18:39:19
App Store,"No way to limit timeline to people you follow/are interested in, so it just shows a bunch of junk I don't care to see. 

Was really interested and hopeful but basic features are missing so its just not useful.",1,2023-07-07 15:45:20
App Store,"How can I add my thread number back on? I clicked hide, now I want it shown.  Thank you.",5,2023-07-07 15:18:22
App Store,"It's a good top app, but please can y'all put the unhide badge thread number on settings",5,2023-07-07 03:29:13
App Store,🖤I love that we can all thread lightly with this platform. Threads have made me sew inspired and believe I will become a threadsetter.,5,2023-07-07 02:33:20
App Store,"Downloaded it, synced all the pages I follow and it worked great.  Fast forward a couple of hours and none of the pages I follow are in my feed.  Not a single one.  I get suggesting  pages I may like, but come on.  Deleted.",1,2023-07-07 01:54:05
App Store,I prefer threading and sewing than hearing all the noise from the birds 🤭,5,2023-07-06 19:23:46
App Store,"Banned within 30 minutes. Hadn’t even posted anything besides “threads needs dms”

You also can only use it if you have an instagram. Which I never had one. Made one just to see and boom banned in 30 mins on launch day. Sad.",1,2023-07-06 17:06:47
App Store,Love the simplicity of the app. Only complaint is you can’t add to share your location in a post.,4,2023-07-06 14:53:10
App Store,"Can’t lie, it’s pretty good so far could see the progress :)",5,2023-07-06 15:56:25
App Store,"So I had enough time to use this app and it’s going places 

All I wish for is:
The ability to have multiple accounts like instagram 
More settings 
Stories should be on threads also 
Direct messaging (end to end encrypted)
And others but overall it’s a very great app",4,2023-07-06 01:18:36
App Store,It needs Direct Message And Calling Voice and Videos,4,2023-07-07 21:15:02
App Store,OK let’s not mess this one up with all the overregulation,5,2023-07-06 00:59:40
App Store,"Threads is very intuitive and easy to use, I haven’t come across any glitches so far but my timeline is super busy with threats from people. I’m not even following.",2,2023-07-06 00:25:38
App Store,App looks great but too much data is being collected.,5,2023-07-05 23:56:37
App Store,"It feels empty, like the first two weeks of twitter. a lot of the feed comes from generic noface accounts meant to increase interactions. It feels like one of those impressive and built to a T north korean cities, just missing the people and life.",1,2023-07-19 09:58:44
App Store,I downloaded it and imported all my stuff from IG but see literally NONE of them. All I see are ads.  I’ve blocked as many as possible until I was just tired of it.,2,2023-07-08 19:24:21
App Store,"1. My feed shows BRANDS and INFLUENCERS and NOT the people I follow.
2. Access to news/journalism is censored, because Zuck wants you focused on BRANDS and INFLUENCERS.
3. No logic to the sorting.

This a huge fail and missed opportunity and I’m going to go back to be completely social media-free.",1,2023-07-08 16:49:33
App Store,"This one is not for me, plus it is like all the “influencers” got a notification saying to promote it because they’re all saying the same thing and pushing followers to join. One more way for Meta to get data #hardpass",1,2023-07-08 12:45:13
App Store,"I posted: ""why do they need access to everything on my phone? Who is Zuck selling all my information to?"" Less than a minute later they had removed it as a violation of community standards!!! Uninstalled.",1,2023-07-08 00:56:45
App Store,They are working on some quality of life issues and threads. But it works and it’s good and I’ll never be back on Twitter.,4,2023-07-06 15:56:22
App Store,"I really hate that threads goings around the Instagrams private wall.. 

Also beware you can’t delete the threads account without deleting the Instagram account connected to it. This needs to be fixed.",1,2023-07-07 16:51:05
App Store,Looks like only instagram uses can log in. Will there be an update to allow users to sign up for just threads ? I don’t use any apps except twitter & I don’t want to create an instagram account just for threads. Would be great if they’re decoupled,1,2023-07-07 00:43:48
App Store,Yes it’s so much better and have so much more potential super addictive btw I’m the first review so take my word 🔥🔥🔥,5,2023-07-06 16:39:16
App Store,You can’t post videos the same length as Twitter and there is no way that you can clip videos at least it should be 2 :30 min videos but you can only post less then 30 seconds,1,2023-07-06 16:11:24
App Store,On twitter it has “for you” and “following” but this seems to only have “for you”. I hate that.,2,2023-07-06 15:30:28
App Store,It should allow users to delete the account.,2,2023-07-06 07:19:07
App Store,"From Instagram/Meta/Facebook, this app claims to be a way to share your thoughts and find your community however just like the parent company you can expect to be censored if you post anything that the left wing app finds disturbing or disruptive to its app. Avoid this garbage!",1,2023-07-06 03:34:57
App Store,I like this app I think it’s amazing you get to connect with your friends and family and a whole new way. Great job guys.,3,2023-07-10 20:09:48
App Store,I liked it at first but there are some issues with this app. There is no way to translate from another language to English. You see a lot of people’s “tweets” that who you don’t even follow on there.,1,2023-07-23 14:33:59
App Store,Could’ve just migrated Instagram to meta bringing everything in-house but you’ve created 3 companies that do the same crap. Nothing new. Now your losing traffic from Instagram or Meta when people use threads or vice versa. Overkill,1,2023-07-21 04:49:31
App Store,"I have an iPad but Threads only has an image the size of a cellphone on my screen. Wasted space all around. No desktop version either. Talk about a half baked rush job. Meta, Make an app for iPad then maybe I might use it. I hate this app.",1,2023-07-19 21:36:54
App Store,"The app just doesn’t work in the EU. Mind you, I’m based in the US but traveling across Europe at the moment. It doesn’t work even with a VPN. So if you are heading here any time soon, keep in mind you won’t be able to use the app at all.",1,2023-07-15 10:13:56
App Store,"all i have to say is that after a day it got extremely boring, as someone who joined hoping for an opportunity to interact with more artists and have some nice conversations. i download it and immediately think ""this won't get boring or die out"" boy was i wrong. its the same thing every time you open it and it's so hard to enjoy. i loved it for a day but ended up deleting a few days later. wouldn't really recommend",1,2023-07-14 22:41:36
App Store,If you miss the freedom of Twitter and enjoy living in an echo chamber of your own leftist drool while all you do is spew hate for Trump all day long. This is the app for you if you love being censored and fed nothing but false information this is the app for you.,1,2023-07-10 21:07:39
App Store,"Threads keeps logging me out of my instagram, which is a little frustrating. Please try to fix this!",3,2023-07-06 03:27:38

App Store,I was just as excited as anyone but now realizing how much of your personal data they have it’s scary. I want to delete my account but there is no option.,1,2023-07-08 17:35:23
App Store,The entire feed is people you don’t follow. Even after I changed settings to “people you follow” it’s still horrible annoying posts. Get on and immediately got girls with no clothes etc. don’t join.,1,2023-07-08 16:14:08
App Store,I never try new apps but sadly decided to give threads a tryna and now I cannot login my account on Instagram. It is stuck in an endless loop and I’m so upset. I CANNOT LOGIN AT ALL since downloading this app. Save yourself the headache and do not download this app.,1,2023-07-07 17:16:58

App Store,do this app is pretty good and there really isn’t anything too bad about it.. it’s like twitter but somewhat better. anyways i think the biggest issue is that if you want to delete your account on threads you have to delete your instagram account too.,4,2023-07-10 10:31:48
App Store,"I can’t get it to load profiles or notifications. Deleted and reloaded it, reported bugs, tried to get in touch with help team, nothing worked!",1,2023-07-16 08:18:10
App Store,It’s like Twitter but no pics or videos and anti free speech why wouldn’t you just write what you have to say with a picture on instagram anyway or post on Facebook both are the same exact concepts,1,2023-07-16 07:18:58
App Store,"But anything is, right?",5,2023-07-10 19:47:08
App Store,"pretty cool app, basically twitter. only thing is that 1. i want to be able to click on people profile pics bc i am blind, 2. there should be like a following only page, kinda like tik tok has, and 3. make it so the post r in order of most recent first

App Store,"No DMs, no chronological feed, no trending, you can’t search threads only users… I could definitely go on. I want this app to succeed but I am surprised that a company as big as meta released such a bare bones app. Do better.",2,2023-07-08 10:41:52

App Store,Much better than Twitter,5,2023-07-06 02:15:57
App Store,"A very bare bones. twitter clone that claims to allow you to follow individuals but doesn’t actually show you posts from those who you follow. No chronological feed just one big algorithmic pool full of brands and influencers. Completely wrongheaded thinking from jump. 
Skip it.",1,2023-07-06 01:29:38
App Store,"You have to be verified in order for your posts to be discoverable. From a posting standpoint, how will I find the people that enjoy what I post?

App Store,"There is nothing original about this app. It’s literally a copy and paste of twitter with 80% less features.

App Store,Great new option,5,2023-07-12 10:33:50
App Store,"The format is bland and boring.
Now matter who you follow, you won’t see their posts. But you do get to see everyone else’s, regardless of your follow list.
Did I mention it’s bland? There is no excitement there, nothing to grab a user’s attention.

App Store,Can’t even see people you actually know or care about on this app. Boring and uninspired Twitter clone just like the rest of Facebook products.,1,2023-07-07 14:41:46
App Store,"i think the threads shows some real promise here. there are some very questionable moves on meta’s part such as 1. needing an insta account to have a threads account (having a separate but syncable account system similar to the instagram-facebook system would work much better and be much more attractive to current twitter users) and 2. deleting your threads account deletes your insta account. this second one in particular just comes off as meta not being confident in its own product. you really need to leverage my instagram account against me to keep my threads account? it’s just sketchy and moving twitter users over to threads will be very hard if this is the case. the other thing this will do is just inflate instagram’s numbers (not to mention overcrowd insta handles and make future insta users not want to join) because people will create burner instagram accounts just for threads. i also strongly recommend adding something similar to the “trending” page or the ability to search for anything other than people’s accounts. this just doesn’t make sense even from meta’s data-broker business model perspective. people currently use twitter and insta very differently, and if the goal is to compete with twitter then you have to have a system that will allow people to use threads similarly to how they would use twitter. this just gives meta more user data to build their platform on because it will give them insight on how people use twitter. what i also wanna say is that meta needs to add either a centralized or separate disable button for collecting data from users’ phones/other apps. the way it seems right now you can only turn it off for facebook, and this will turn people off because it makes people wonder “well does it also turn it off for insta and threads or is that separate?” meta has already implanted the sort of meta hub in the instagram settings to control all of one’s meta accounts. make it clear that disabling meta from accessing data from the parts of my phone that aren’t meta apps disables it for ALL meta apps and services. this will build trust with the community. overall, threads is a great idea. meta is probably the only company that can outcompete twitter, but it needs to adjust itself in a way that is welcome to twitter users in order to do so.",3,2023-07-07 05:35:54

App Store,"I write this review to not only speak of the good of Threads but also to share my thoughts on how to make it better than not just Twitter, but also Facebook. 

I deleted my Twitter account years before Musk took over it, and even then I lost interest within 6 months of having it. There were so many flaws about the sheer environment of Twitter that pushed me away from using the app. The two main flaws were that of negativity and drama from every bit of content that I was seeing. Threads has great potential in being different. I was actually interested in joining it and the app had an inviting feel to it. Now here are my thoughts on where to improve when updates come…

Make the Home page/feed only show posts/content from my followers and those I chose to follow. If anything else, possibly for every 10 posts, show me a suggested post based off of my likes, reposts, and who I follow. Nobody needs/wants to see what some random company or celebrity posted, whom they did not follow or show interest in the first place. Make this app even more inviting by filling it with content the user already liked and associated with, hence their followers and likes. 
Abide by Instagram’s Community Guidelines to a tee, if not harder. A big problem that I noticed Twitter had was the sheer indecency it had in its seemingly nonexistent post guidelines. A person could post something inappropriate without any fear of their tweet being removed. Make this app average person friendly, while also making it a place for people to voice their opinions/beliefs. 
Keep Threads and Instagram separate in terms of deletion. If for some reason I want to delete Threads, I should not worry about it deleting my Instagram. 
No matter what, do not ad us to death. Ads are not inviting, and if there ever comes a time when you do allow ads, limit them to a bare minimum and at least make it content that we’ve actually shown interest in by engagement. 
Use a few concepts from Facebook in Threads. Such as, if I search up “Atlanta Braves” I can have the option to see posts, videos, groups, hashtags, or pictures about the Braves. Add that feature to the search tab in the Threads app. 
Put the home page, which as I said should all be my followers and those I follow, in chronological order. The first thing I should see is the most recent post made. 
Keep users’ private information private and not allow any such personal information about the user be infiltrated by the software or hackers. Again, make this app a secure platform for individuals to use.
Lastly, give users the ability to customize the look of their Threads display. Such as different color schemes, text font and size, and the Instagram bio link that users currently have. Give them the ability to make the app appeal to them in looks and in sharing across account platforms. 
Hope all of this helps! I don’t know if Meta will see this review, but I sure do hope that they will continue to improve upon a platform that already has great potential.",4,2023-07-08 05:25:20

App Store,"Threads does what it’s intended; it’s a nice, emerging alternative to Twitter, with all of the infrastructure and ease of use ready to go. But there’s things it could do better. 

First of all, the app’s functionality is smart. As I wrote, the friction is nonexistent, and it’s almost too easy to integrate all of your platforms. I love the idea of this app being decentralized, and I hope that’s something that Instagram develops well, as decentralization can make further integration even easier and eliminate issues peculiar to other platforms. 

I didn’t attempt the other alternatives (I last accessed Mastodon perhaps in 2018 and so my opinion is invalid there), but because I already have Instagram and an honest Instagram following, this was the easiest with the least friction to jump into. As a result, I can’t compare Threads to anything but Twitter. And among the features it’s most missing is Twitter’s feed curation. 

 Social networks thrive when they give us greater choice in terms of what we desire to consume. I don’t desire to read the posts of vapid celebrities when my only use case for this type of social network is sports, a handful of other niche interests, and seeing what friends are interested in or talking about. Instead, we see people who are famous for being famous. According to some who disliked Threads, this is where they fumbled the ball, and so they likely could have drawn even more engagement than the incredible numbers they have drawn already if their feeds were a blank slate or correlated with the feeds they already curated on Instagram via a recommendation algorithm. If they replicate Instagram’s feed presentation with fewer interstitial posts (or Threads), and replicate Twitter’s function of being able to follow and engage with Topics that you enjoy, and develop thus a feedback loop of similar content to fill your feed instead of people you don’t know (or at least have them relegated to a separate Recommended tab), this could be infinitely better than even Twitter. I would also like for Threads to retain its small–user feel; everyone feels important, and that’s cool. Allow us to have a chronological order to our feed as well, or even reverse chronology, if we’re interested in that sort of thing. A dark mode for those whose smartphones aren’t set in dark mode. Better presentation in Settings would be great as well; it’s a bit of a mare’s nest at the moment. Provide us with more rational choice. 

I’d like to see the implementation of a separate tab with local, regional or national news, similar perhaps to Facebook (which I haven’t used since 2014 and so have no familiarity with) as well as Twitter, and that’ll make it even better. Avoid replicating where Twitter has gone objectively wrong, too — such as a two–tiered hierarchical system in which individuals who pay a fee have primacy and those who don’t have none. A better, less clunky GUI similar to that of Instagram’s breezy, sleek GUI with old Twitter’s level of order and presentation, as well as Threads’ simplicity, would be great. Better video functionality would be great, too. I already know Instagram is great at developing and integrating new features; I can see a Communities feature á la Telegram. (Please allow us to exercise consent and choice with respect to future gimmickry.) 

I edited this paragraph after some two to three hours of use. Accessibility is important — and that’s what Threads is missing at the moment. Instagram does accessibility relatively well with captions, alt text, and translation. Perhaps even integrate tone indicators. I can imagine how a person who doesn’t speak English would feel acute linguistic isolation here.

Another choice they can give us is in the customization of not only our feeds, but also our accounts and user experience. This also includes empowering us with the choice to retain data we choose not to share, and thus not only address preexisting privacy concerns (another valid concern about this app), but also allow for expansion into the European Union. Allow us to import posts from other platforms (which I believe fediverse governance will certainly facilitate), or even export them from, say, Twitter. Allow us to have our own display names and other customizable presentational features; allow us to deactivate without having to deactivate our Instagram, or even allow us to delete our accounts off Threads, and don’t force Threads onto Instagram users who only have interest in or provide imaginal content on Instagram. Give us choice and power. Develop a unique identity in which the user is king of his destiny, not ruled by an algo’s nudges and whims. And you’ll have a winner — a true “Twitter killer” in which Twitter is reduced to “the other app.” 

I see this being a great app, but it really depends on the people at the helm and product managers listening to consumer feedback (including mountains of consumer feedback from Twitter’s failures over the years as well as looking within to its parent company’s other subsidiaries and their failures) and constantly improving. Color me skeptical; I have no reason to believe any company will do the right thing, but I’m welcome to being proven wrong, because this surely has everything going for it — and, as far as I see, it’s all going in the right direction.

Twitter was important for me, not only for sports and social integration but also especially for news during natural or unnatural disasters, especially since my city’s local news base has declined drastically despite us being especially vulnerable to tornadoes, floods and violence. Twitter’s decline and self–inflicted technical difficulties has complicated all of that privileged access. Threads can not only step in that breach, but also mend it — and not only for me, but for tens of thousands of others. So far, I and many others can see the Sun rising for Threads. Now, it’s up to you all at Instagram to keep the ball rolling.",4,2023-07-07 18:05:28

App Store,Don’t like the idea of one company owning all media and this is a bad design,1,2023-07-16 02:17:25
App Store,"So far I’m really liking this app, but there are many key features that are missing that I feel should have been present with the initial release. Here is a list of features I think this app should have to thrive (especially to compete with twitter wink wink)

1. Please for the love of god add an option to upload photos in 4K. The whole point of having an app to compete with twitter is to have photos in amazing quality. How’s the time to actually do your part and integrate that feature

2. An edit option (cmon now…) this should already be in the app as a feature. Let us edit posts.

3. Discover tab and following tab. There should be a tab or filter that allows you to only see posts of the people you follow. No one wants to see these celebrities that genuinely no one gives a rats behind about. Also a discover tab will allow people to find users or posts through hashtags or by allowing people to see whatever is trending. 

4. If you want to be better than Twitter then let us download videos the same way we can download photos. Cmon bro it’s not that hard just make it work. 

5. I know this is a shot in the dark but…there should really be an option for censoring posts, which allows nsfw to exist on the app without harming people who don’t want to see it. Allowing a disclaimer to show before viewing a post is a good way to do so. 

6. Allow users to create lists of their favorite accounts/posts so they can easily go back to them and find what they liked in the past. 

7. Include a tab on the account for photos/videos only similar to a gallery. 

8. Allow people to make group chats and dm each other privately.

9. Longer video upload duration 

10. Allow us to edit/crop photos or videos before posting. And also let us schedule posts/save drafts.

I think all these things will really improve the app and allow it to thrive as much as we all want it to. So take it into consideration (:",3,2023-07-10 16:19:49
